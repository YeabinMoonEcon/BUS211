	\begin{itemize}
			\item Demand for economists is procyclical
			\begin{itemize}
				\item fluctuations are primarily driven by the academic tenure-track positions in the US
			\end{itemize}
			\vspace{1mm}
			\item Entry conditions would affect the initial placement outcomes
			\begin{itemize}
				\item  recessionary cohorts are less likely placed in tenure-track academic positions in US
				\item quality of placement would not be affected
			\end{itemize}
			\vspace{1mm}
			\item Recessionary cohorts are less likely to work in academia in {\small  long run}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the cohorts publish fewer journal articles in top 50 journals
			\end{itemize}
			\vspace{1mm}
			\item Economists rarely switch the occupations over time even if the entry economic conditions were not favorable
			\begin{itemize}
				\item economists develop task-specific human capital

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Analyze the effect of entry conditions onto the labor market outcomes overtime (Kahn 2010, Oreopoulos et al. 2012, Schwandt and von Wachter 2019, Yu et al. 2014,  Maclean, 2015, Ball 2021)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item earnings, labor supply, health, family formation, crimes
			\item effects vary by education, major, race, institutional settings (Altonji et al. 2014, Beiler 2017, Choi et al. 2020, Liu et al.)
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{1 mm}
		\item Literature estimates the effects on the outcome using cell-level model and the coefficients on entry conditions allow to vary with experience
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Mincerian proxy for the labor market entry and rarely takes account occupational choice
		\end{itemize}
		\item I use an individual-level model and do not allow it to vary by experience
		\begin{itemize}
			\item individual characteristics are observable and important sources of variations
			\item shocks mainly affect the initial placements and economists are immobile after 
			\item my  data includes exact timing of entry and almost complete employment histories
		\end{itemize}
     %	\item Less freedom of entering the market

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Job mobility plays a crucial role in recovering from the early damages  (Van den Berge 2018, Cockx and Ghirelli 2016) 
		\vspace{1.6 mm}
		%\item Effects vary by education levels, race, institutional settings 
		%\item Unlucky college graduates tend to work in less attractive occupations / firms
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item start and stay longer in lower-wage occupations (Altonji et al. 2016) and industries (Oreopoulos et al.
%			2012)
%			\item higher-earning majors typically fare substantially
%			better in recessions relative to lower earning majors
%		\end{itemize}
		%\item I find 
		\item Human capital formation vs Signaling 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item initial investment in skills specific to occupation keeps a person on a certain career trajectory (Gibbons and Waldman 2004, 2006)
				\item bad signaling from starting in a less favorable job hinders unlucky graduates to from switching occupation when recovers (Nunley et al. 2017)
			\end{itemize}
		\vspace{1.6 mm}
		\item Empirically demonstrates the connection between the task-specific human capital and economist's mobility and how it affects a range of outcomes

	\begin{itemize}
		%\item Different theories would lead to different expectations about the persistent impact of entry conditions
		%\item The effect of the initial placement is particularly important for economists
		\item Human capital accumulation is largely determined during the first decade of one's career in high skill occupations (Rosen 1990, O'Flaherty and Siow 1995)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item problem would be critical at research universities, in which tenure decisions are determined within 5-7 years
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{1.5 mm}
		\item Job mobility would raise  questions on the transferability of skills 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item more costly for  whose skills are not transferable across jobs
		\end{itemize}
			\vspace{1.5 mm}
		\item If task-specific human capital is an integral part of the skill-acquisition process, then cohort effect could arise (Gibbons and Waldman 2006, Jin and Waldman 2019)

			\begin{itemize}
				\item valued similarly in occupations where similar tasks are performed
			\end{itemize}
%		\item suppose there are two types of tasks: research and teaching
%		\item both types are in general productive in many occupations, and occupations combine the two tasks in different ways.
%		\item called specific because they are only productive in occupations where similar tasks are performed
%		\item different from general skills or occupation specific skills
	%	\item appreciated in occupations where similar tasks are performed
		
		\end{itemize}

	%\vspace{1 mm}

	\item Literature use occupational and industry codes from the census
	\begin{itemize}
		\item change in occupation means the skills required for new occupations would be substantially different from those used in the old 
		\item need to build another index because of the small range of occupations economists would work at
	\end{itemize}
		\vspace{1 mm}
	\item I define occupations into the following categories
	\begin{itemize}
		\item R1 university
		\item All other universities in US

	\begin{itemize}

		%\item Purpose of modeling is to show whether workers human capital is valued more depends on the initial placements; and that workers more likely move where the tasks are similar
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item switching firms or occupations for individuals is defined as having different firms or occupations in $t$ compared to  $ t- 1$.
%			\item all firms are contained within occupations, so individuals can only switch occupations if they also switch a firm
%		\end{itemize}
		\item A firm $f$ assigns the combinations of tasks $\left\lbrace 1,...,J\right\rbrace $ to a worker.
		
%		\item Suppose that task-specific output in a firm $f$ within $o$ is produced by combining multiple tasks, denoted by $j=1,...,J$
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Occupations combine the tasks in different ways, and let $\beta_o^j \in [0,1]$ be the relative weight on the  task $j$
%		\end{itemize}
%		
%		\item Worker $i$'s task-specific output $Y$ working at $f$ in $o$ and $t$ 
		\item $i$ produces cumulative task-task-specific output $Y_{ifot}^j$
		\begin{equation}
			\log{Y_{ifot}^j} = \sum_{j} \beta_{o}^{j} a_{iot}^j + \mu_{if} \;\;\text{where } \sum_{j} \beta_{o}^j = 1 \;\;\text{for all }o=1,...,O
		\end{equation}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\beta_{o}^{j} $ is the share of time a worker spends on average in the task $j$ in  $o$
			\vspace{0.8 mm}
			\item $a_{iot}^j$:  $i$'s productivity for task $j$ at  $o$ and time in labor market $t$

		\begin{itemize}
