	\begin{itemize}
		\item Evaluate job mobility to assess the impact of entry economic conditions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item recessionary cohorts would take longer periods of time to find a job match
			\item spending time in bad matches would lead to wage losses and would result in wrong investment in human capital

	\frametitle{Preview: Findings}
	\begin{itemize}
			\item the demand for economists is pro-cyclical
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the fluctuations are primarily driven by the academic tenure-track positions in the US
			\end{itemize}
			\vspace{1mm}
			\item Entry conditions would affect the initial placement outcomes
			\begin{itemize}
				\item  recessionary cohorts are less likely placed in tenure-track academic positions
			\end{itemize}
			\vspace{1mm}
			\item Recessionary cohorts are less likely working at the academia in the long-run
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the cohorts publish fewer journal articles in top 50 journals
			\end{itemize}
			\vspace{1mm}
			\item Economists rarely switch the occupation over time even if the entry economic conditions were not favorable
			\begin{itemize}
				\item economists develop task-specific human capital
				\item occupations are quite specialized

		\begin{itemize}
			\item earnings
			\item employment 
			\item health and other outcomes
		\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Contribution: Occupation Choice} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Job mobility plays a crucial role in recovering from the damages for those who start in a recession (Van den Berge 2018, Cockx and Ghirelli 2016) 
		%\item Effects vary by education levels, race, institutional settings 
		\item Unlucky college graduates tend to work in less attractive occupations / firms
		\begin{itemize}
			\item start and stay longer in lower-wage occupations (Altonji et al. 2016) and industries (Oreopoulos et al.
			2012)
			\item higher-earning majors typically fare substantially
			better in recessions relative to lower earning majors
		\end{itemize}
		\item I find 
		\item Human capital formation vs Signaling 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item initial investment in job skills specific to an occupation tends to keep a person on a certain career trajectory
				\item adverse signaling from starting in a less prestigious job hinders unlucky graduates to from switching occupation when the labor market recovers

		%\item The effect of the initial placement is particularly important for economists
		\item Human capital accumulation is largely determined during the first decade of one's career
		\begin{itemize}
			\item problem would be critical at research universities, in which tenure decisions are determined within 5-7 years
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{1.5 mm}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item more costly for individuals whose skills are not transferable across jobs

		\item Further test whether one ever switch occupation or firm   \hyperlink{mobility}{\beamerbutton{appendix}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item as the model predicted:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item less likely switch the occupation
				\item if one switched, it would happen within the same occupations at early periods
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize} 
			\item One might raise the question of whether the entry condition would serve as a signal of ability, and its importance as a signal declines over time as more information of true ability is revealed \hyperlink{signal}{\beamerbutton{appendix}}
