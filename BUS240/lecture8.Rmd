# Lecture 8
## Maps

Choropleth maps show geographical areas or regions that are coloured, shaded or patterned based on the data. 

We see this often during [election](https://www.270towin.com/2022-house-election/) days.

Each of these maps shows data for the same event, but the impressions they convey are very different. Each faces two main problems. 

1. The underlying quantities of interest are only partly spatial.
  - Can we disaggregate information further?
2. The regions themselves are of wildly differing sizes, and they differ in a way that is not well-correlated with the magnitudes of the underlying votes.

## 1. Electoral data in U.S.
