<section>What is the supervised learning?</section>				   
<section>The most common supervised learning tasks are regression (predicting values) and <br>classification (predicting classes)</section>
<section>What's the difference?</section>
<section>What's the example of classification problems?</section>


<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">Classification is a predictive task in which the response variable $y$ is
			discrete or categorical</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">discrete: it takes on a set of discrete numerical values</li>
			<li class="fragment">categorical: it belongs to a set of categories <br>(also called classes)</li>
		</ul>
		<li class="fragment">Examples</li>
			<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Is a credit card user going to default?</li>
			<li class="fragment">Which product will a consumer buy?</li>
			<li class="fragment">Which market will a firm enter?</li>
			<li class="fragment">Which  candidate will an individual vote for?</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>When this modeling frame would make sense?</section>


<section>To fit within this framework, the set of alternatives needs to exhibit three characteristics</section>

<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">First, the alternatives must be <em>mutually exclusive</em> from the decision maker's perspective</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Choosing one alternative necessarily implies <br>NOT choosing any of the other alternatives</li>
			<li class="fragment">The decision maker chooses only ONE option from the choice set</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</section>	

<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">Second, the choice set must be <em>exhaustive</em>, in that all possible alternatives are included</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">The decision maker necessarily chooses one of the entire potential alternatives</li>			
		</ul>
		<li class="fragment">Third, the number of alternatives must be finite</li>
		
	</ul>
</section>	

<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">The first and second criteria are not restrictive</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Appropriate definition assure that the alternatives are mutually exclusive and the choice set is exhaustive</li>			
			<li class="fragment">For example, suppose two alternatives A and B are not mutually exclusive because the
				decision maker can choose both</li>
			<li class="fragment">The alternatives can be redefined to be "A only," "B only," and "both A and B"</li>			
			<ul>
				<li class="fragment">opt-out option is also fine: "none of them"</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>		
	</ul>
</section>	

<section>Often the researcher can satisfy these two conditions in several different ways</section>
<section>The appropriate specification of the choice set <br>is governed largely by the goals of the research and <br>the data that are available to the researcher</section>
<section>Let's continue a thoughtful exercise</section>

<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">Consider households' choice among heating fuels</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">The available fuels are usually natural gas, electricity, oil, and wood</li>			
			<li class="fragment">Do these alternatives violate both mutual exclusivity and exhaustiveness?</li>
			<li class="fragment">The alternatives are not mutually exclusive because a household can have two types of heating</li>			
			<li class="fragment">The set is not exhaustive because the household can have no heating</li>
		</ul>		
	</ul>
</section>	
<section>The researcher can handle each of these issues <br>in <em>several ways</em></section>
<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">To obtain mutually exclusive alternatives, <br>one approach is to list every possible combination of heating
			fuels as an alternative</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">“electricity alone,” “electricity and natural gas, but no other fuels,” and so on</li>			
		</ul>		
	</ul>
</section>	
<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">Another approach is to define the <em>primary</em> heating source among others</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Under this procedure, the researcher develops
				<br>a rule for determining which heating fuel is primary when a household
				uses multiple fuels</li>
				
				<li class="fragment">By definition, only one fuel (electricity, natural gas, oil, or wood) is primary</li>
		</ul>		
	</ul>
</section>	
<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">The advantage of listing every possible combination </li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">avoids the need to define a “primary” fuel</li>
			<ul>
			<li class="fragment">a difficult and somewhat arbitrary distinction</li>
			</ul>
			<li class="fragment">also, we can examine the
			factors that determine households' use of multiple fuels</li>
		</ul>
		
		<li class="fragment">Downside is the increase in data requirment</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">eg. every cost combo of fuel</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>The researcher will need to take these trade-offs into consideration when specifying the choice set</section>
<section>The same type of issue arises <br>with regard to exhaustiveness</section>
<section>Researcher can either include “no heating” as
	an alternative or can redefine the choice situation as being the choice
	of heating fuel conditional on having heating</section>
<section>
	
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">The first approach allows the researcher to examine the factors that relate to whether a household has heating</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">this ability is only realized if the researcher has
				data that meaningfully relate to whether or not a household has heating</li>
		</ul>
		<li class="fragment">Under the second approach, the researcher excludes from the analysis
			households without heating, and, by doing so, is relieved of the need for
			data that relate to these households</li>		
	</ul>
</section>

<section>As we have just described, the conditions of mutual exclusivity and
	exhaustiveness can usually be satisfied, and the researcher often has several approaches for doing so</section>

<section>The problem is in fact on the third condition: <br>the number of alternatives is finite</section>
<section>This is in which the classfication problem would be different from regression models</section>
<section>Consider the savings problem:<br> How much money would you save?</section>  
<section>If there is an infinite number of alternatives, classification models cannot be applied</section>

<section>Often regression models and classification models are distinguished by saying that regressions examine choices of <em>how much</em> and classification models examine choice of <em>which</em></section>
<section>This distinction, while perhaps illustrative,<br> is not actually accurate</section>
<section>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">Consider the choice of how many cars to own</li>
		<ul>
		<li class="fragment">the alternatives are 0, 1, 2, and so on, up to the largest number that the researcher considers possible (or observes)</li>
		<li class="fragment">contain a finite number of mutually exclusive and exhaustive alternatives, appropriate for classification analysis</li>
		<li class="fragment">can also define the choice set more succinctly as 0, 1, and 2 or more vehicles</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</section>

<section> In the case of savings accounts, every one-dollar increment (or even every one-cent increment)
	can be considered an alternative, and as long as some finite maximum
	exists, then the choice set fits the criteria for classification choice</section>

<section>Whether to use regression or classification models in these situations is a specification issue <br>that the researcher must consider</section>
