				  <section>Read Chapter 1: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition</section>
				  <section>Let's start with an example</section>
				  
				  <section>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Suppose you are a marketing analyst</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">investigate the association between advertising and sales of a particular product</li>
							<li class="fragment">data set consists of the sales of that product	in 200 different markets</li>
							<li class="fragment">advertising budgets: TV, radio, newspaper</li>
							<li class="fragment">Your client can control the advertising expenditure in each of the three media</li>
						
						</ul>
						
						
						
					</ul>
				</section>

				  <section>Our goal is to develop an accurate model <br>that can be used to predict sales <br>on the basis of the three media budgets</section>
				  <section>I am Yeabin Moon, Ph.D.</section>
				  <section>Your TA: Yvonne Wang</section>

				  <section>The first class of the college lectures is 
					<br>very unproductive</section>

				  <section>We are going to do some unproductive stuff today</section>
				

				  				 
				  <section>Ok, now we are going to talk about this class</section>					
				 
				  <section>But, first, who are you?</section>
				
				 <section>Consider the following questions</section>
				 
				 <section>If you were to plot the average revenue per seller on the Amazon marketplace, what would the shape of the distribution?</section>

				 <section>Can you answer this question?</section>
				 <section>There is no single class/book <br>teaching you everything you'd ever face</section>
				 <section>Is this a methodological question?</section>
				 <section>What'd we need to learn to answer this question?</section>

				 <section>What is a data analytics?</section>
				 <section>We'd believe that data has some information</section>
				 <section>The method is on how to retrieve it</section>
				 <section>Huge obsession on method and data </section>
				 
				 <section>Data analytics $\approx$ Problem solving skills</section>
				 <section>Have to acknowledge the limitations</section>
				 <section>Incomplete model:<br>housing price prediction</section>
				 <section>Inherent ambiguity: I saw her duck<br>
					<img src="pics/pic1_1.png" width=400 class=""fragment><br>
				 </section>
				 <section>Information bias: gender classification</section>
				
				 <section>We are going to learn the science of learning</section>
				 <section>Vast amounts of data are <br>beging generated in many fields</section>
				 <section>Our job is to make sense of it all:<br>extract important patterns and trends, and understand what the data says</section>
				 <section>And, we are going to talk about its capabilities</section>
				 

				 <section>This class is about learning from data using Python</section>
				 
				 <section>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">In most cases</li>
						<ul>
						<li class="fragment">have an outcome measurement </li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">usaully quantitative or categorical </li>	
							<li class="fragment">wish to predict based on aset of features</li>
						</ul>
						
						<li class="fragment">have a training data</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">build a prediction model, or learner</li>	
							
						</ul>
						<li class="fragment">validate its prediction using a test data</li>
						</ul>

				<section>Let's to review the syllabus</section>
					
				
				
				
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">The class is based on Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook)</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">web-based interactive computational environment for creating, executing, and visualizing Jupyter notebooks</li>
						</ul>
						<li class="fragment">The easiest way to get started coding in Python is by running it in the cloud</li>
						<li class="fragment">At present <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a> seems to be the most reliable</li>
						
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Tutorials on how to get started with Google Colab can be found by searching</li>
						<li class="fragment">Written examples include</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/google-colab-tutorial-for-beginners-834595494d44">Google Colab Tutorial for Beginners</a></li>
