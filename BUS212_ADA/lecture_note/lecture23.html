<section>Most data analytics course concerns supervised learning methods such as regression and classification</section>				   

<section>They are really good for inference or prediction tasks</section>
<section>The minimum requirement is a labeled data</section>
<section>Now, we will focus on <em>unsupervised learning</em>,<br> a set of statistical tools intended for the setting in which we have only a set of features $X_1, X_2,...,X_p$ measured on $n$ observations</section>
<section>We are not interested 	in prediction, because we do not have an associated response variable $Y$</section>
<section>Rather, the goal is to discover interesting things about the measurements on $X_1, X_2,...,X_p$</section>

		<li class="fragment">Unsupervised Learning is a difficult subject</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Supervised learning is a well-understood</li>
			<ul>
			<li class="fragment">well developed set of tools for model and their assessments</li>
			</ul>
			
		
	</ul>
	<li class="fragment">In contrast, unsupervised learning is rather subjective</li>
			<ul>
			<li class="fragment">there is no simple goal for the analysis</li>
			<li class="fragment">hard to find a standard</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>If we fit a predictive model using a supervised
	learning technique, then it is possible to check our work by seeing how
	well our model predicts $Y$ on test</section>

<section>However, in unsupervised learning, <br>there is no way to check our
	work <br>because we don't know the true answer: <br>the problem is unsupervised</section>

<section>Techniques for unsupervised learning are of growing importance in a number of fields</section>
<section>Most popular: exploratory data analysis (pattern search)</section>
<section>In NLP, it is about everything</section>

<section>In fact, we have already done: PCA</section>

<section>Another popular application is <em>Clustering</em>:<br> to group similar obs together into clusters</section>

<section>Clustering is a great tool for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems, search engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and more</section>

<section>We will examine two clustering algorithms:<br> k-means and DBSCAN</section>
