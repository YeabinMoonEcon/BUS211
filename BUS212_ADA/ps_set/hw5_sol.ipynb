    "A node's Gini impurity is generally lower than its parent's. This is due to the CART training algorithm's cost function, which splits each node in a way that minimizes the weighted sum of its children's Gini impurities. However, it is possible for a node to have a higher Gini impurity than its parent, as long as this increase is more than compensated for by a decrease in the other child's impurity. For example, consider a node containing four instances of class A and one of class B. Its Gini impurity is $1 – (1/5)^2 – (4/5)^2 = 0.32$. Now suppose the dataset is one-dimensional and the instances are lined up in the following order: A, B, A, A, A. You can verify that the algorithm will split this node after the second instance, producing one child node with instances A, B, and the other child node with instances A, A, A. The first child node's Gini impurity is $1 – (1/2)^2 – (1/2)^2 = 0.5$, which is higher than its parent's. This is compensated for by the fact that the other node is pure, so its overall weighted Gini impurity is $2/5 \\times 0.5 + 3/5 \\times 0 = 0.2$, which is lower than the parent's Gini impurity."

    "Decision Trees don't care whether or not the training data is scaled or centered; that's one of the nice things about them. So if a Decision Tree underfits the training set, scaling the input features will just be a waste of time."
