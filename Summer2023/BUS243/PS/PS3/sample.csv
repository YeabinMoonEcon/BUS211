While growing up in Dallas we would always go to a local produce joint that a family friend owned. The tomatoes were always fresh, local, and packed with flavor. A scattering of local and/or organic food items plus plants for your own garden. Now I have found my Nashville version of Gene's Fruit Stand. 

Produce Place is small but you can tell that all items are chosen very selectively. Local fruits and veggies are great but my favorite items are the fair trade coffee and granola wall. The local cheeses and organic snacks are pretty awesome too! 

Disadvantages... I hate to include these, parking is a bear plus prices are more than Publix (but worth it). Biggest frustration is when I realize about 6:45 while making dinner that I forgot a veggie and then remembering they closed at 6:30. Either way, get your veggies here.

This place was nearby with high yelp ratings so I stopped in to give it a try. The place was pretty packed so I thought it seemed promising.  It was AMAZING. All their smoked meats are smoked in house. I had the smoked pulled pork which was to die for. For sides I had potato salad (yum!) and fresh fruit (basic). They also give you cheese muffins to start which are very good. Bartender was very friendly. Def a great place to stop!,2011-08-16 03:28:05

We decided to try it out  ourselves.  We got the outdoor sitting which was great and love the water view.  Ordered our appetizers and dinners plus our alcohols.

Which was very disappointing may I add because we expected our appetizers first while waiting for our entrees.  Our dinner food was a disaster because it wasn't hot nor warm.. COLD!  Not once did our waiter come by our table to check on us to see IF we wanted anything else like more refill on the soda or more alcohol.  My Birthday dinner was very disappointing and was not happy.

Mandarin makes great cocktails, is reasonable priced, has an awesome decor - and always makes me feel welcomed.  Thursday night is my favorite night to stop by the bar- it is $5 mule night and they have a variety of ginger beer based drinks at least one of which is sure to be perfect for you.  My favorite is the Mezcali Mule- which is mescal blended with ginger beer in a fantastic spicy, smokey combo that is sure to hit the spot.  But if that isn't your style- try the classic Moscow Mule or Dark & Stormy and enjoy being in a nice bar having a good drink. 

Any night of the week you can stop by and have a great cocktail. All of the bartenders are professional and I have never received a bad drink. 

I love the Mandarin Hide... but, so do lots of other people.  On weekends the bar can be crazy crowded and overwhelm you with people.  The bar staff- making their meticulously awesome drinks- are not fast, and with large crowds it is easy to be frustrated at this bar.  It is narrow on the inside without a lot of seating.  As much as I love this bar I usually avoid it as it gets later and more crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. 

Additional notes: 

*There is often a live blue grass band in the bar- which is an awesome touch.
*During the holidays they fill the bar with the biggest Christmas tree you will find downtown.  
*They have an excellent selection of craft bourbons- want to try pappy? This is a place you can do it. 

You can't go wrong with a classy cocktail bar that knows what it is doing.  Stop in and find out for yourself.",2016-02-06 01:16:34

It feels like a very Americanized Korean restaurant.

I had the spicy pork bulgogi and teriyaki beef with fried rice. The spicy pork bulgogi was ok, nothing special though.

We had a long discussion about my grandmas limited walking abilities. We were assured my 92 year-old grandma would be able to take "" 5 tiny steps"" to get to these seats.  When we arrived we realized that there were several sets of steps, none were  tiny and it was absolutely not an option for us. My grandma had actually fallen here in the hallway several years ago, breaking her pelvis. 

We were here to see American Idol live, my grandma's favorite show and it was going to be extremely upsetting if we were going to have to cancel. Phyllis showed up and after explaining the situation she gave us several options of seats in the back row and checked for us if they were available. They were, and my grandma was able to maneuver into the seat  easily so that we could watch the show. Not only did Phyllis save our evening, she was extremely kind while doing it. Without her, either we would have had to leave or my grandma would have been sore for days or even weeks after. I appreciate Phyllis, and I would consider her a true asset to Ruth Eckerd Hall.

Why, you might ask..
1) Parking!  To work in Nashville where parking is either a challenge or expensive, thrilled to have a dedicated lot that's well lit and easy.
2) Breakfast.  Yum.  Lots of breakfast options for lots of different palates, and it's all comfort/southern/yumminess.
3) Lunch.  Good burgers and sandwiches, and one of my favorite mac and cheese sides anywhere. Other options, too, but lots of variety and usually just what you're looking for is somewhere on there.

I also like that they have a VIP room where if you need 20 people to eat together, and you don't want to go the private dining set up menu route... that can happen here.

The Row is owned by the same folks who have The Honeysuckle down in Franklin where I live, and I enjoy there as well... but that's a whole different experience and price point.

We had a friendly server who, although she admitted she was new, was moderately knowledgeable about the menu, shared the specials flawlessly, and did her very best to answer our questions.  She opened our bottles and catered to us right off the bat.

We ordered an antipasti app that was for two, but really could have served a table of 4 or 5.  It was overflowing with italian meats, cheeses and grilled veggies.  I ordered Spaghetti Carbonara and my boyfriend ordered Ravioli Bolognese.  My meal was delish - it was the first time I ever had Carbonara and it was exactly what I expected - rich, creamy, and cheesy.  The meat sauce on the Bolognese was also great - it had a rich, tomato-y taste and plenty of meat.

We were not rushed or bothered, but our server remained attentive.  We wrapped up the leftovers and ended the meal by splitting a chocolate soufflee topped with ice cream.  Perfect size for a sweet little bite.

Would love to get back there and maybe pair it with a movie, and try something else on the extensive menu.  Also, their lunch menu with pizzas and paninis was also long and looked great.

It was for highlites and a cut/style.  I felt confident when I learned the owner of the salon was going to do my hair.  We discussed possibility of ombre (cool at the time) but really I just wanted to lighten up a bit for summer.  So it begins.

The highlites went in.  Afterwards, I watched the stylist grab my ends hanging out of the foil highlites, take her bleach brush and slap bleach on the ends of my hair.  Don't panic I thought.  Trust her.  She's the professional.  After I talked myself of the ledge, and the bleach had done it's job, it was time for a shampoo.  Obviously the guy shampooing me didn't like to touch people.  It was the worst shampoo of my life.  He seemed scared to touch my hair.  Perfect.  

I got back to the chair.  My dark hair was now overwhelmed with highlites.  And the ends were yellow.  All of them.  The stylist blow dried and curled my hair.  Ok.  This is ok.  I'll get used to it.

The next day, I got ready for work and did my normal shower, blow dry routine.  Once the curls were out, there was a straight line of bleached hair the last four inches of my hair.  It was awful. Almost tear worthy.  I'm a teacher in my 30s.  Not an 18 year old bar star.  I called the stylist to ask if she could put a toner on it to make it less ""bleachy"" looking.  I even said I was willing to pay for it since I had expressed interest in ombre.  She had given me her personal card so she asked me to call the salon to book a time to come in.  I called and left a message.  I called again.  Nothing.  No response.  I hated it so much that I called around to get it fixed.  I felt stupid with this terrible bleach job so I shelled out another $120 elsewhere to have it fixed.  I was so disappointed that no one from Fluid bothered to get back to me.  I would not recommend this place at all.",2014-07-28 19:02:08

I already paid for the food beforehand, I gave her $40 and she gave me $16 ish in change. Is she that highly incompetent that she forgot within five minutes? It wasn't even busy. Word of advice, ask for a receipt when you pay because they don't take debit or credit and will forget within two minutes that you paid for your food. Train your employees better!

The manager was kind enough to send me a gift certificate to try this place again. My boyfriend and I stopped by on a late Sunday night to celebrate his birthday. He was excited as a taco fan and has never been here before.

It was busy for a late Sunday night, 9 PM. They don't take reservations but will put you on the waitlist. I called 40 minutes prior to arrival to be placed on the waitlist. When we arrived, we had to wait another 15 minutes which wasn't too bad. We were seated outside which was romantic and not as noisy or crowded.

For food, we had:
1. Chips and gauc: 5/5 stars. This was our favorite.
2. Corn on the cobb: 5/5 stars. Very surprised how unique and flavor it was and I'm not a corn person. Drizzled in parmesan cheese. 
3. Assortment of tacos: varies from 3 to 4 stars. It pains me to say this but the tacos still did not blow me away. My bf concurred that they weren't bad but weren't memorable either. Favorite was the fried shrimp, tuna tartare and swordfish. Although we ordered an assortment of tacos, our order was messed up. We did not get the chicken, duck or 2 falafel tacos. I only mentioned about the missing falafel tacos since those are my favorite. On the bill, it had charged us for 4 falafel tacos instead of 2 but again, dinner was complimentary. The presentation of the tacos did not look appealing because it did not have the taco dividers so all the ingredients seemed to slide off to the next taco. It was confusing which flavor was which despite the waiter's explanation. Perhaps putting a small flag with the flavor. 
4. Carne asada bowl: 4/5 stars. The steak was tender. The rice was a bit odd in texture. It seemed rubbery and undercooked. 
5. Margaritas: 4/5 stars. It was delicious but pricey ($9)for the amount you get. My order was messed up because I had ordered the mango margarita but it tasted like house regular margarita. Again, I didn't mention it. 

Service: 
Initially our waiter was attentive but he disappeared towards the end of the night. When our bill came, we waited over 20 minutes for someone to come take our card. I saw the waiter stop by 2 tables to take their orders and never came back to us. The manager was nice enough to stop by our table during our meal to check up on us and to finally take our card. He comped our drinks. 

Overall, many thanks to Bartaco's manager for inviting us back for a complimentary dinner. I am still scratching my head about a few hiccups during the experience in terms of food and service. When I called to be on the waitlist, I asked about what birthday features would be available. The person said candles on a churro. However, our waiter never mentioned it even though I mentioned it was a birthday. But by that time, my bf was ready to go and didn't want to wait for it.",2019-02-18 13:27:28

Our chips, queso, and guac were delivered to our table right away. And the server was quick to accommodate our table with extra bowls and chips. If you haven't tried their gauc and queso - you really should. Seriously top notch. 

Most of the girls got margs while I tried to opt for the less caloric option of corona light. They def enjoyed their half price margs though! 

For dinner I went with the taco salad- it has pineapple on it which offered a refreshing twist on this hot summer day. You can customize it so I got the BBQ sauce removed and they offer 3 diff types of dressing to pair with it. Which I honestly ended up not even using bc it was so good without it! 

I have ordered multiple things here before so you really can't go wrong with whatever you choose. Nachos are huge - def recommend sharing or taking some home for later!

This restaurant is near our home, so we're thrilled they opened in the nearby strip mall. We have eaten at the Gandhi restaurant on Fort Lowell in Tucson. The Flavor of India is run by the children and their spouses, who grew up in the Gandhi environment.

The ambiance is light and airy, with booths and tables available. The quality of the buffet food rates an A+, for variety and quality of preparation. The spice level is low for the mild eaters among us. A small tolerance of tang would be advisable for most Indian food. This buffet had Samosas, saag (mushy spinach), Vegetable Kofta balls, lamb balls, Tandoori chicken, paneer and peas Chicken ?Murtha (chicken pieces in a creamy tomato-ey sauce; really good), daal (lentils), saffron rice, cauliflower and a few other entrees, plus a fresh salad. Freshly baked (on the Tandoor) naan bread (garlic or plain) is served at your table. (NOTE: I've eaten here before; their buffet choices do rotate.)

Freshly made condiments accompany the buffet choices, including tamarind sauce (the sweet brown color sauce) and the mint-lemony sauce (forget its name). (I'm striking out on some nomenclature-forgive me!). Dessert on the buffet included Kheer (rice pudding in milky base with flavoring) and a coconut milky cube sweet (forget its name). 

Everything was superbly prepared. There is something for everyone on this buffet, from the mild-mouthed to the vegetarian to the carnivores in the family. We saw plenty of families there (it was Sunday, noon) and it was quiet and peaceful. Service was efficient and pleasant. I've known these ladies (the wives) (I asked--the menfolk were out on vacation today, it being the July 4th weekend), and they did a great job ""manning"" the fort, so to speak. 

Don't miss this place. It's also nice to support our local restaurant entrepreneurs who work very hard to give us a fine dining experience.

Recognizing that we're tourists to Nashville, we definitely had a bit of trouble locating their distillery. Otherwise, the renovated mill location is very cool.  I'm glad that it yis a little offset from downtown. 

My wife and I had a bit of time to enjoy one of Corsair's robust winter ales before starting the tour of the micro distillery. The atmosphere of the brew pub was cozy and the bartender was welcoming and very knowledgeable of their beers on tap. 

The tour of the distillery was outstanding! The entire operation takes place is a small warehouse behind the pub. With the expertise of a professor and the whit of a comedian, our tour guide led an engaging tour.  He explained how their process is distinct from other distilleries, as well as the special touches that make Corsair whiskies and alcohols accolade worthy. 

All of the information we gathered from the tour made me excited to visit the spirits room. Corsair's whisked and gins surpassed my expectations, which were already set very high. I cannot say enough about our tasting experience. The bartender and tour guide explained the character of each taste succinctly and accurately. Not a one of our tastes were less than superb. Also, our bartender was a highly knowledgable and engaging young lady. After only being at Corsair for a few months, she knew the history of the company and the details of their products thoroughly. Also, she kindly offered us a few of her mixed drink recipes and booklet full of other Corsair mix drinks recipes. We walked away with a couple of bottles. 

I can't say enough about the warmth and passion of the staff of Corsair. Each of them care deeply about their products, and they make sure that tourists enjoy their time at the distillery. The tour guide/ manager was particularly passionate about all the items listed above. Whatever the leadership of Corsair is doing is worth being emulated by any company. Their staff appear to love their jobs, the product is phenomenal, and their company culture appears to be very personal and warm. Clearly, I cannot say enough about our visit to Corsair.

I recently went just to see if anything had changed. We got no up-sells, and service was decent (not vivacious, just decent). The food is still good and they're still expensive for what you get. E.g. they charge $3 per glass of lime-aid and make it very clear that there are no free refills. Honestly, it tasted so watered down it was like a glass of water with some lime and sugar flavoring. I recalled it being better. I frequent another restaurant (more upscale in many ways) where they charge $2.50 including unlimited refills. There's a lot of margin in Mexican food but Rosa's is charging what the market will bear. And they can - the place is popular, and I can't blame them for their success. But don't go expecting a Mom & Pop atmosphere or modest prices.

But they do pay attention to the food, and the flavors are subtle but very good. Most dishes are not at all spicy (some might even say bland), and it's probably an Americanized version of Mexican food. But I still liked it.

I will be focusing purely on the chicken here as this is a chicken shop. We'd ordered mixed assortment of Willie's original chicken which included chicken breasts, wings, thighs, and drumsticks. Food was brought over to our table in a nice cardboard housing containing steaming hot pieces of freshly fried chicken with a nice crunchy exterior. The batter itself had abundant nooks of crannies and you could easily see the generous peppering within it. Breaking pieces off would yield hints of cajun seasoning and spices inside, evidenced by the bright orange hue. The meat was so hot that I had trouble picking at the breast meat underneath the wet batter, so I could tell this wasn't chicken that was just sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Breading was seasoned well, though at times a bit uneven as I thought the breast pieces were a bit saltier than the thigh (which did have a thinner layer of skin and batter). The quality of the chicken meat was nothing special, just the standard variety (don't think many fast food places sell freshly butchered chicken) but there were no demerits to this. All in all, a solid piece of chicken. I wish I had tried the cajun chicken tenders but I'd argue that the original recipe has an edge over KFCs, and slightly better quality of chicken over my fast food favorite, Popeyes (though Popeye's spicy chicken seasoning is still my favorite)

Price

Prices were reasonable for the upgraded quality of chicken. 8 pieces were 16.99 and 16 pieces were 26.99. Cajun tenders were slightly cheaper at 14.99 for 8 pieces.

Service

This is a self service fast food restaurant but there are people who will bring your chicken over once you grab your number and place it at a table. Seating is self-service. If you want water, you'll have to ask for it at the bar as the soda machines doesn't dispense water.

Overall

A solid fast food fried chicken joint with reasonable prices. Seasoning isn't anything special, and if anything, a tad bit salty, but if you're craving warm fried chicken that's better than the stuff you can find at a convenience store and don't wish to fry up your own, Willie's is open late for some late night munchies until 1 AM.",2017-08-21 03:41:09

So I got a hold of a couple of their specialty slices.  I went for a chicken parm slice, and a buffalo chicken slice.  The chicken parm slice was excellent with some good thick tomato included on it.  

But let me write about this separately.  Now maybe this is happening more often than I realize out there, and I just don't run across it as much.  But the buffalo chicken slice included french fries.  I'm talking french fries on the darn slice!

You know, in general I really don't need french fries on my buffalo chicken pizza slice.  I'd have been perfectly happy with just a buffalo chicken slice unadulterated.  In fact, I hope sometime that I can actually have an unadulterated buffalo chicken slice here.  i'm sure it would be really good on its own.

However, if you ever get the opportunity to have a slice of some form of specialty pizza that includes french fries directly on the pizza... DO IT!  Believe me when I say that I wasn't complaining about this even a little bit.

For the amount of money they are charging, they should improve the decor and ambiance of the place.  The service was also subpar.  For a group of 6, we had to constantly ask for water refill and did not get any bibs for our table.  I think good service goes a long way! 

On the bright side, the oysters were good and the mussels with sauce was great too. The live crawfish was alright but I've had better made at home....by brother and sister in law.

Usually it's like oh okay it's ice cream that tastes kinda like donuts. Nah bruh this was literally like eating a donut that somehow looks like ice cream.

I told them that we had changed our minds. The lead then shifted gears and said he also represented another company, UNDER COLONIAL PENN, but one that asks health questions for better rates.  We invested the time to hear him out.  We filled out papers, INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND EMPLOYMENT LOCATIONS, etc., (thinking that this was a ""reputable"" and ""established"" company, trusting them), but when we refused to do an electronic signature, they agreed to return two nights later at 5 pm WITH PAPER COPIES.

Prior to Noodle Kitchen, Before-NK(B.N.K.)South Tampanians like me had to venture north of Kennedy Blvd to find good mostly authentic Asian food. Imagine the horror. Now that is no longer the case. I ordered the egg noodle bowl with tofu and with all of the included vegetables on it except for bok choy. I also took some pineapple chili sauce and thai chili powder from their complimentary sauces and spices bar. All of the sauces and spices are created in the restaurant. However I recommend the pineapple chili sauce because the other sauces mainly sambal chili and anchovy vinegar are extremely spicy. The noodles were delicious and so were the tofu and vegetables. However they do not make their own tofu and I'm pretty sure that they do not make their own noodles from scratch. The price of course is around 1.5 to 2 times the price you would pay for similar Asian food north of Kennedy, however, considering it is located in the trendy SoHo district, the prices are not too bad. The ambiance and design of the place is reminiscent of a hipster Asian-American takeout joint that is frequented by upper-middle class millennials. One of my major complaints about the Noodle Kitchen is the lack of tofu in my noodle bowl. Only six pieces of tofu in a $14 noodle bowl. That is just atrocious! At Thinh An Kitchen and Tofu I can get a much larger noodle bowl with a lot more tofu for only $8.00. The service, however, is quick just like at Thinh An Kitchen & Tofu. Parking is often very scarce especially on weekends, but that applies to almost any place in the SoHo district.

Some of the best baseball fans in the world reside here.  If you get a chance to take in a concert here, do it!  But of course, the baseball is what brings you to this awesome place!  I would say take in a Cubs V Cards series here for sure.  Stuff for the young ones and the young at heart.  Lots of fun little things for the kids to do including a Build a Fredbird (Build a Bear) Workshop.  I love that the ballpark is accessible for those with disabilities and the elderly who may need a little extra assistance.  A little tip for those not drinking, sign up to be a designated driver and you get a free soda.  Considering they are $5 or more, that is a good deal.  For other ways of savings, groupon, travel zoo, the Cardinals website, etc. often have excellent deals.  On Sundays you can get family packs that included hot dogs and soda.  While they have typical ballpark fare, there are some intersting stands that have some local favs such as toasted ravioli.  Garlic fries are a personal favorite.  Yes, you can obviously get all the AB products you want but if you know the right places to look, you can find some good microbrews such as Schlafly (bleachers bar and Casino Queen bar), Goose Island, Urban Chestnut (Section 142).  You can take items into the ballpark like bottled water and soda.  You cannot take in cans so be warned.  Whatever you do, HAVE FUN AND GO CARDS!",2011-06-29 02:38:58

So when we found this little place just outside of Nashville we were excited by a chance to enjoy a traditional southern breakfast and an authentic environment. Seemed great at first with lots of signed photos of celebrities on the wall and kitschy country decor.  The waitress seemed friendly enough letting us plug in our phones and helping me figure out if there was any dairy and their margin packets.  But that was where it ended. I had very specifically explained to her that I cannot tolerate any dairy, that it literally makes me quite ill but she still buttered my toast and had to remake that and then my eggs came out sopping in yellow forcing me to have to ask again if they had used butter. Now if the place had been busy, I would understand how she could make these mistakes but now it's clear to me why we were pretty much the only ones in there. So I wait again while my toast and grits are getting cold for them to remake my eggs.  I'm thinking, yay finally and am to enjoy my favorite go to comfort food.  Grits eggs and toast has been my go to favorite meal my whole life and I've not had much opportunity to enjoy it since traveling so extensively most of the time.  But oh my gosh, looks can be ever so deceiving. The grits were beyond inedible. The most I could manage to choke down as two bites. All I can figure is that they try to reconstitute or something and it's only 7:30 in the morning. My daughters home fries are dry and boring squares with no flavor whatsoever and she also is leaving them virtually untouched.

Many friends have raved about how amazing this place is, so for a special occasion my boyfriend and I decided it was time to give it a try! We brought a bottle of our own wine, and also decided to try some of their cocktails, too, for the full experience.

Our meal started with the Meatballs, more specifically a place with two gigantic meatballs and a generous dollop of ricotta cheese. As an Italian person myself, I'm hesitant to order meatballs while out to dinner. These were fine, lots of garlic and a pretty decent gravy. My favorite aspect of this dish was the ricotta. 

For our main dishes, I had the Cacio e Pepe and my boyfriend had the Spicy Crab. Both of our pasta dishes were delicious. Though the price point was on the higher side in my opinion for an average portioned pasta dish. I think the best portion for price is the Chicken Parm. We saw another guest order this and when it came out, it looked to be big enough to serve two people and leave left overs.

We ended our meal with a round of drinks. I tried the Carina Sangria, a red sangria with berries. My boyfriend had the Negroni. Both very standard drinks that tasted great. My only complaint is that the berries were very mushy at the bottom of my glass and did not taste great when they came up through the straw. I had to made a conscious effort to avoid getting any berry remnants in my straw. 

Overall, this meal was nice and our server was attentive. I think it's overpriced for what you get. I didn't feel that this was the best Italian meal I've had in the city, but I can see the charming appeal of Trattoria Carina that makes it a popular spot.",2021-08-26 11:17:42

The couch area is very comfortable and quiet and a great place to sit and read while sipping on your delicious coffee. They also have a bookshelf of donated books which you can take a book to read while sitting there or trade one of your books for another. I think that aspect adds a little more charm to the coffeeshop (not that it is lacking in charm or anything).

Once you understand the process and what they've got available, it's pretty simple. They press their dough instead of the others who have it pre-rolled, which is kind of neat. Also they're nice enough to add calorie information on everything. 

Other than that, it's pizza. A regular pizza and a drink is about 11 bucks, which is enough. They're sufficiently filling and the presence of a definable, thicker crust is pretty nice. The use of shaved mozzarella rather than the traditional shredded version is also pretty nice. I'm pretty sure you'll find toppings you like, I went with chicken, jalapeno, artichokes, olives, and onion. 

Of note, their drink selection is pretty unique. They have a few unique drinks like Lime Mint cooler and Blood Orange lemonade, and they also carry Blue Sky products on tap. 

I guess that ""pretty nice"" is the best way to sum up my experience at Blaze. It's pizza. It's hard to screw up pizza.

The product: Mediocre at best. I went to Banana Mousse with a couple friends because I was craving dessert and it was something new. I was intrigued by the description that it is ""a cross between ice cream and pudding, but taste like neither"" but see the reason is - it taste like nothing. Got the chocolate flavor and my friends got birthday cake. The only actual flavor came from the cookies/cake on top. (-2 Stars)

The business practices: Only two bites in to my flavorless mistake, I took a glance at the lid only to notice that the month and day of the expiration date had been crossed out with marker. To confirm what information was missing, I looked at a friend's to see his expiration date was there (28/6/19). Sickened by this and knowing they were about to close, I quickly returned to the store in search of a refund. Paying $7 for a little bucket of crap, that I'll do... but $7 for an expired bucket of crap is down right disrespectful. When I returned to speak to the manager, I explained the situation. She was well aware that this food safety transgression has taken place. (-2 Stars)

The customer service: Despite this, she stated she could not issue a refund because the factory seal on the product they ""make fresh daily"" was broken. She suggested that if I didn't think it was fresh I throw it away. (-2 Stars)

Here are all the peculiar things about her response:
1. If you are making products fresh daily, why are they factory sealed and dated in a European format? Who in Europe knew what date you were making these?

2. If you are making products fresh daily, why would the two products purchased the same time have ""best used by"" dates in different years?

3. If you are making products fresh daily, why wouldn't you refund a purchase made 30 minutes before closing? Wasn't it about to end up in the trash so you can make tomorrow's fresh batch of mush?

4. If you are the manager of an establishment, why would you ever be so unprofessional as to end an interaction with a customer by suggestions they throw your product away?

In conclusion, there's not enough quality dessert in West Philadelphia. Banana Mousse has done nothing to change that. Realistically this establishment deserves a -1 Star rating, but in adherence with Yelp standards this is the lowest score allowed. Luckily there's a Fresh Grocer a 7 minute walk from this rubbish place, and for $7 you can more than satisfy your sweet tooth there.",2018-07-09 03:27:11

I initially met with Brent and I was impressed by his presentation and his knowledge.   I submitted the tax paperwork I had with me the same day and a couple of days later brought in the rest of the information and submitted it to Emily (the receptionist).  I left it at that and expected the taxes to be filed accordingly.  Unfortunately several months passed and I did not hear anything (Brent had told me that they were very busy so I thought it must be normal for them to have such a delay).  I touched base with Emily again over the phone and she stated that she would inquire about my tax return and get back to me.  Again, I did not hear back for an extended period of time, at which time I sent two emails to Brent.   Finally,  Brent called me back and apologized and explained that my records had been mistakenly placed in the ""incomplete"" file.  Shortly thereafter, he complete my tax returns and waived the fee, both of which I appreciated.  

Unfortunately, the problems did not stop there.  For the 2018 tax year they failed to have my tax return completed on time.  Apparently they require that all tax material be turned in by March 15 and I did not have all my tax paperwork turned in until after.  Now, I am not disputing this policy.  What I do have a problem with is just how disorganized, incompetent and unprofessional they are.  The reason I say this is that I called them several times, over and over and even touched base with them via their email address and all I got was the run around.  Even though I uploaded all of my tax material onto their website portal as they had instructed me to and verified with their receptionist that it had been uploaded, they had NO clue that I had presented new material to be incorporated into my tax return.  Also, Emily specifically told me over the phone the Friday before tax day that they would be working over the weekend and that my taxes would be completed on time (she mentioned nothing of the above policy).  Finally, on tax day, after multiple repeat calls I was finally connected with Dan (the owner).  I tried to explain to him that they have very poor customer service and that I am frustrated with the fact that I have to contact them over and over again and with the run around treatment that I have been getting and he started yelling and saying something to the effect of ""don't lecture me"" and he abruptly hung up on me at the end. 

I have used many CPA's throughout many different states in the past and this is the first and only time I have encountered such unprofessional and negligent behavior.  I would have gladly respected them had they told me upfront that I had turned my tax material in too late and they would need to file an extension.  On the contrary, I had to contact them on a repeated basis only to get false and incomplete information and finally be told by the owner not to ""lecture him"" and that my taxes will not be completed on time despite earlier contrary information.  

Lastly, the original tax material that I provided to them when I originally met with Brent have all but disappeared.  I say this because when I went to obtain my source documents, they only provided me with the few pieces of paper that I had originally given Brent and not the additional material that I had given to Emily to add to my file.  Therefore, one can only wonder as to the amount of information that they failed to include in my tax return and the amount of money that I have lost as a result.  The mistake on my part was not making copies of the original source documents before submitting it to them, a mistake I will not make in the future.  

I encourage whoever is reading this review to think twice before doing business with this organization, and only after having done your due diligence and being mindful and very careful of their subpar business practices.  As they say ""the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.""  If the very individual who established the organization says ""don't lecture me"" rather than listening to a customers complaints and trying to come to an understanding of how such grievances can be prevented in the future, then how do you expect the rest of the business to behave?!

Not only are half the pictures on the website false advertisement (the lobby and bar have been gutted...the bar being the whole reason we chose to stay here), but the construction crew was laying down carpet outside our room. We had to maneuver around their work for THREE DAYS, with the full experience of hot glue smell, dust and general construction noises.

Granted, I understand the need for doing improvements, but we would have made other plans if we had even an inkling of the inconveniences in store for us...not even at a  discount.

Two redeeming qualities, although meager, were the historical building itself, which we did appreciate, and the lovely staff. Unfortunately, we chose the place off of location and website pictures only. This experience will have me looking at reviews from now on.",2014-12-19 20:15:54

This place shouldn't stay in the Delmar loop for long... In just a year it has most definitely outgrown the space. The wait times can get excessive but they are always worth it. 

First, get the brisket. If you have a chance, get double the brisket. You don't need a knife and likely won't need sauce at all. The mustarolina on the table is good-looking but ask for their white BBQ sauce that isn't out on the table.

Also, the deviled eggs appetizer is not your co workers pot luck contribution...... These are deliciously crafted deviled eggs with proper seasoning, topped with bacon. Get it. Worth it.

While you're at it, pair a few fingers of bourbon with your meal. The Bowman options are really delicious.

Ask for the bacon cheddar popovers.

And St Louisans I know you're going to be mad... But they have some of the best toasted raviolis I've ever had...

The only cons:

Very limited wait time seating area. You can sit at the bar as well.

Valet Parking - When we drove up - there were no signs for the valet. We pulled up and were told that we needed to go back around and go to this small street. A sign would have been helpful and useful. Valet parking seems a little steep at $49 per night. 

Checking In - We must have gone in at the wrong time as a conference was going on at the same time. The check in line was long. When we checked in, we were given our comps for breakfast but not our bag of bottled water for being Hilton Honor members. The front desk clerk wasn't overly friendly nor did he seem thrilled at the front desk. I didn't notice this until I saw someone else with a bag.

Room - Since we booked through a third party vendor - the hotel picked our room. We ended up with two doubles. Which was fine, however....This was the worst bed that I've ever slept on. It was sooo uncomfortable. I'd like to add that I can fall asleep anywhere, the problem was that I couldn't get comfortable at all. Also, we could not get the temperature in the room to a comfortable setting. It was either too hot or too cold. Also, the second night we slept in the other bed thinking that there was a possibility of it being more comfortable. We ended up finding a credit card receipt in the sheets from 10 days ago - which makes me cringe at the thought that they didn't even change the sheets and just remade the bed. 

General Atmosphere - I would assume that it was largely in part to the conference, but I could hear people going up and down the hallways. Talking, laughing and partying well into the night. Every time I would just about fall asleep on the most uncomfortable bed - I would hear a bout of laughter or yelling voice every 5 minutes.

Food - We didn't eat lunch or dinner in the hotel. I wish they would have mentioned any happy hour specials - we headed outside the hotel for all of our lunch and dinner options.

Closing -  I will never stay here EVER again.",2017-06-08 13:57:09

We  can't eat wheat and we called ahead and asked about that and they were knowledgable. When sat down and we ordered weren't willing to sub a veggie stick or a GF cracker so I ate the hummus with a fork.  Not ideal.

I asked if we could have those drinks regular price at the table and was directed to the cocktail list on the menu of four items.  Really?  I was willing to pay.

I haven't been to a PF Chang's in ages, and last time I went I remembered the menu being tiny and the food not all that unique or interesting.  I do however go to Pei Wei quite often, so my wife and I figured we'd give the place another try since we were in the area.  It's come a long way since the last time I went and there are a lot of options for everyone.

Most impressive was the fact that they had a dedicated vegetarian section and marked everything on the menu that was vegetarian.  This is not something common from a chain, so we were delighted.  My wife got the coconut curry vegetables and I got the sauteed eggplant, and we split the green tea noodles and garlic snap peas for sides.

All the food came out hot and was extremely tasty.  I've made eggplant at home a few times and it's never been as tender or sweet as it was here.  The chili garlic sauce it came in was so good that we were dipping everything else in it.

The service was also fast and friendly.  My only gripe is that they offer a ""meal for two"" option where you get to choose your appetizers, entrees and desserts, but almost none of the vegetarian options are on it.

It was very clear from the start that Larry had no intention of actually trying to diagnose the problem.  He even had the nerve to tell me ""It doesn't smell bad in here now"", only minutes after showing up, like I was making up the smell and it was all some big lie to get Larry to come to my house for the fun of it.

I then showed Larry our plumbing and each of our bathrooms, particularly the bathroom where the smell seemed to be originating.  The apathy was obvious the entire time he was here.  The visit ended with me giving him the required deductible and me telling Larry to ""just leave"" without any clearer idea of what the problem may be.  The reason we called a plumber was to get a diagnosis from a professional about what was causing the issue.  What we got was an annoying waste of time from a very shady company.

Cons: 1 toilet for the women.
The lights behind the performers are bright, bright, bright lights that hit the audience that are sitting up close to the stage - with an almighty glare. There's no way to sit at the front tables and take photos of the performers.

Turns out that $25 was in addition to the $15 price for a regular manicure. The regular manicure was having my cuticles clipped and my hands dipped in parafin, no arm/hand massage. Every other salon I have gone to charges $25 for a whole manicure and the Shellac polish. Overall, it was a good experience, but definitely not worth $40 plus tip. If you decide to go, make sure to check out their website so you know what your getting. 

The staffed seemed nice and didn't constantly talk to each other, which definitely let me know that focusing on doing a job is important to them.

I finally went to a different dentist office and was told that the tooth has a crack on the inside and the onlay just covered it up.

They have their own house-made sauce (Chubasco) which is fantastic.  My personal favorite is the Habanero version - medium spicy (for me, I have a high spice tolerance) and VERY flavorful.  It's fantastic on whatever you happen to put it on.

I've tried quite a few of their dishes, and they are consistent and produce great food each time.  The La Paz fish taco is something I tend to order almost every time I've been here.  Great little fried fish, tasty pico, and some yummy mayo-based sauce on top with a squeeze of lime and delicious with a TON of the Chubasco hot sauce.  The San Juanico fish taco is terrific with a pineapple based salsa.  I've also tried a grilled fish taco (decent) and their black bean taco with the pineapple salsa (awesome for vegetarians).  

I've also sampled their wings with the traditional buffalo hot sauce - they were surprisingly great.  The skin was crisp and the meat was nice and tender.  The buffalo hot sauce was more flavorful than hot but it was a very solid wing.

We've also tried their Landing Nachos and the Loaded french fries which are pretty much nachos only on fries.  Their guacamole is solid, and the pico has a good balance with the savory and acidity aspect.  The servings are large for these two items.

My husband has tried a couple of the burgers, which are always cooked to temp correctly and he says they are solid burgers.  He's also tried the fish sandwich and really enjoyed that.

I've tried, for their lighter fare, a couple of their salads, and they used fresh ingredients.  They offer their salads in half and full sizes which is great - I typically am good to go with the half size.  One of their best dressings is a house made one - the vinaigrette is flavorful and delicious.

Service can be hit or miss - typically it's on the more solid side, but sometimes it can be a little spotty.  That tends to be when it is filled to capacity so do take that with a grain of salt.

The decor is retro, funky, fun. As other yelp reviews have said, it is loud. 
Margaritas are probably my most favorite cocktail. I was excited to try the El Vez original and pink Cadillac.  Both were good, but I've had better.  Nothing to rave about honestly. 
The guacamole on the other hand was delicious. I would highly recommend ordering this appetizer, which is a very generous portion.
For my main course I got the shrimp tacos.  They were very light and fresh.  It was just enough, especially after the guacamole and drinking margaritas. 
Overall, I think this place is slightly over rated.  It is good food and a fun atmosphere, but I can think of a hand full of Mexican restaurants that are just as good or even better.",2015-01-19 01:22:26

Right now during the pandemic, it is window service only but it looks like a cute little convenience store inside. There is quite a bit to choose from on the menu which I loved. I always love a good Cuban so I decided to give there's to try. I've definitely had better but good. The bread was nice and crisp but there was no mojo pork, just deli meats.

Breakfast is probably my favorite meal of the day while on vacation because typically every city has their own gem or gems around every corner. I kept seeing CafÃ© Fleur De Lis on the list. I'd even Google, yes Google places to go and CafÃ© Fleur always showed up. So I did just that.
 
My first attempt was failed as the wait was too long and my stomach didn't allow any waiting.
 
The next day was much more successful. We were greeted and essentially seated immediately with only a minor wait for our table to be cleaned. I immediately felt the warmth of the restaurant. The small restaurant with its tables closely sat together didn't have central air, like most places in New Orleans it had fans and old-fashion air conditioning units so needless to say, it was a little moist up in there. I noticed a second floor, but not sure what's up there and never ventured to ask.
 
Speaking strictly of their breakfast because that's all I cared about. I noticed a decent selection, but knew instantly I wanted their Big Easy Breakfast. Maybe just because of its name? Two eggs, sausage and bacon, grits or hash browns, toast, and pancakes all for around $13. Count me in.
 
Within honestly 4 minutes. I swear. I was almost nervous how quickly it came. Was it sitting there waiting for us to order this? I don't think so at all, but that's how fast it appeared.
 
The breakfast overall was good. Nothing to write home about, with the exception of their pancakes. If nothing else, get a stack of those. They are amazing. I had to look up online and find their recipe or secret, which I believe is some sort of creamy (heavy cream I believe, but don't quote me I'm still investigating). They didn't really even need syrup. Maybe just butter if that. They were exquisite.
 
The service was solid. Our waiter was a great guy who told us stories about the restaurant and the city in general. He checked on us and made sure our experience was as perfect as it could be.
 
Four starts solely for those pancakes. Everything else would be three. It's a solid place. I see why people like it. Would I love it without those pancakes? Maybe not, but fortunately, I don't have to worry about that because those pancakes aren't going anywhere!",2018-09-06 18:56:27

This past weekend I had my first experience at Mario's and I regret not dining here more frequently. 
The restaurant is in a strip mall located between a 7/11 and Daquiri Deck. It is a small space with rustic Italian decor which makes it feel intimate went you walk in. 
We had a party of 5 and were sat immediately. Bread was served with pesto for the table and it was quite delicious. I opted for the tomato bisque instead of a salad and it was good, but not the best I have had. The soup was slightly too thinned out for my taste. My entree was the veal piccata. It was lemony and the pasta was a perfect al dente. My only criticism was the veal was not very tender. The real standouts of the table were the lobster ravioli and the carbonara. They lobster ravioli was packed with lobster filling and served in a delicate cream sauce. The carbonara was rich and creamy and had big chunks of perfectly rendered pancetta.

Situated on the corner of an industrial block, this quaint wine shop turned live music venue and cocktail bar (upstairs) has become one of my favorite spots in NOLA. 

You will enter through the wine shop, you have the chance to purchase a bottle of wine (mark up is regular rate of 50-100%) or a glass of wine (daily offerings listed behind the counter). The glasses they offer in the shop are ""funky"" so if you're in the mood to try something different this may be your best bet. I was in the mood for a glass of Cali red (which wasn't on their glass list) and they very kindly shared with me that the upstairs bar has the traditional wine glass options (like Cali reds). I appreciated their guidance as they could've easily talked me into getting a wine I didn't want but they really want to make sure everyone has a good time and enjoys their beverage of choice. 

I was also pleasantly surprised to see that had a refrigerator filled with various meats and cheeses - you just pick the meats and cheese you want (different portion sizes available and they have the price on them) and bring it to the counter to pay. That's when the delightful surprise happened, I thought I'd just snack on the cheeses in the plastic cover but no, they offer ""to make a cheese plate"". YES! Say, yes! You won't regret it. I literally thought they would put the cheese on a plate for us but we got a delightful cheese board spread with all the accoutrements you expect (bountiful bread, jams, compote, olives, walnuts, etc). 

It was incredibly hot and muggy outside (had been raining throughout the day) so we opted to sit in the bar on the 2nd floor. It was a lovely wooden bar (and air conditioning thank god!) and they sold glasses of wine and cocktails (full bar). The staff were very attentive and kind. 

The 2nd floor bar overlooks the (huge) outdoor patio in front of the stage where they have live music daily. 

I hadn't planned on a staying the whole evening here as we were bar hopping and checking out quite a few sights and sounds so now that I know what a lovely place this is I will make time to stay for the whole evening. 

Pros: The wine. The Cheese! The cheese boards! This place is just cool and laid back. Excellent staff and service!

Did not dine at the lobby restaurant but it looked really nice. Overall, I would say the decor was striking. We spent some time in the bar downstairs while waiting for friends each night and it was also very nice. They have live music too and it seemed to get full every night. 

The rooms were all very nice, spacious, elegant and clean. I love the contrast between the modern decor and rough brick walls. I only wish my side of the bed would have had a side lamp. We only had one on my husband's side which made it a little dark. The bathroom was also beautiful with just enough counter space. 

Our room faced Canal and it did get a little loud sometimes at night with some rowdiness and traffic. Loud, for like a second before we passed out from all the fun we had at which point it became irrelevant.  Lucky us I guess. 

Hotel was priced very well given it's location. We walked pretty much everywhere and about 5 minutes to Bourbon. Royal was our favorite though. So much shopping!  If we had to cab it, it was no more than a 10 minute ride. It is also right next door to the Ritz.

I then notice the bottom of the cup has been perforated by a thumb or something. So I go to the counter and tell the lady I just made a big mess cuz there's a hole in my cup. She gives me a dine-in style red plastic cup this time, and I start filling it up and realize there is white residue inside, so I dump out the soda and see that the cup is pretty greasy inside and out. Gross! I go back up to the counter and this time she gives me another styrofoam cup.

So the lady brings me my food and I'm thinkin she's about to mop up all the soda I spilled all over. Nope, she went to the bathroom for awhile instead. Then I quickly realize my food isn't hot, it's not even warm. The sauce is cold, and the meat is cold. I'm thinkin no biggie as long as it tastes good. Nope, it's the toughest beef brisket I've ever had!

So it's really not that good, and I don't even eat half of it. So I go to the counter to ask for a to-go box, and this black lady is behind the counter. She can't address me or ask ""can I help you?"" because her mouth is stuffed with food, and she's eating from her hand. Apparently she's a bigger fan of the food there than I am. So without wiping her hands or anything, she grabs me a white stryrofoam container, and I quickly realize it's dirty inside and out. I'm looking at it, and she goes ""oh, is that clean?"" I'm like ""almost"". So she answers ""well we touch alot of sauce and stuff soooo..."" She then hands me a cleaner one. I say cleaner, because that one had grease on it too.

While all that was going on, I observed the white lady there using the broom behind the counter. It really wasn't doing much good, and I was thinking a steam cleaner would have been more appropriate, because that work area/food prep area was a filthy, greasy, disgusting mess!

So I'd give the leftovers to my neighbor's dog, but I'm thinking he really deserves better!

The only positives were that the portions were actually pretty good, and the potato salad was good. The corn bread muffin was pretty big, but was brought to me on my plate shrink-wraped. Wtf? So it was a lil wet, and not that good either.

Aside from that, my lunch portion meal was like $12, which I feel is a lil high. 

The decor is nice if you like ""Oakland style"" graffiti.

Ok, the good

New games - tons of new sit-down multi-player racing games
booze - they has it, along with tables you can set it on while you play games
Dress code - theoretically this keeps thugs out
Ticket games - keep the kids busy while you're drinking
Skee-Ball - really, it's gotta be there

There's a lot of stuff to do at D&B that's fun.

The bad

I went there with my little brother recently, there is an insane disparity in pricing in the children's games. One of them we won 60 tickets at (played for 8 seconds) we discovered cost more than the last 2 games both of us had played for the previous 8 minutes. I'm not too worried about this, but kids are going to see 60 tickets and not realize they're blowing several bucks for that.  Eh...

Staff are not entirely on the ball yet in ways that I can't really explain... 

I'm not entirely sure the state of the video game industry, but it seems kind of odd that my phone has better graphics than a large chunk of the ones they have.

Seemed to be a lack of Street-Fighter-style games. Mostly racing and large gun games on the adult side, and ticket games that have been out for over a decade on the kiddie side.

Don't know, I was expecting more variety, more polish. I'll be back in a couple of months to check them out again.",2012-01-03 19:53:27

 Anyone who grew up in Deleware County knows this place, and has probly been painfully pecked by a chicken here. You get alot of bang for your buck @ Lynn- ville. Admission is free and you can pet and feed all the animals there , from chickens to emus. 
 They have a playground with really cool sets, not just the usual swings and slides (for example , wooden pirate ships, tractor trailers,castles, etc.) Its free but they have a honor box where you can do $1 per kid (or nothing at all cheapskate!). This playground also includes a little barn where you can jump in the hay and the most devious fence maze ive ever experienced. No matter how many times I go I wind up getting lost in there as my kids burn though it  and laugh at me.
 From spring to fall, they usually have something going on each weekend. Always very family oriented. I agree that on weekends it can be a madhouse so go on a weekday for your first time. Food is really good but it loses a star because i recently found out that the pies they make are not made on premesis anymore (theyre still better than supermarket pies.
 This place is so hot that back in the late 90s, it actually burned to the ground! (that may not be the real reason).

Oh science museum, how I love thee. I was way overdue for a visit after I thought it would be fun to check out the disgraceful Creation Museum in Kentucky. Sounds intriguing, right? Don't do it! But that's another review. I really needed to come here and cleanse my mental palate.

Some background, I grew up in Nashville, so I used to come to the Cumberland Science Museum (its former alias) A LOT as a child. It was my favorite school field trip destination, even though I made straight C's in science class. I was excited by the dinosaur exhibits and the hands-on displays galore. I remember being blown away by how huge this building is, and how you can climb all the way to the top. 

While I'm not exactly six anymore, I still frequent this museum, and it's still huge to me. They have frequent exhibit rotations, and no one looks at you strangely if you come without children. They have a number of fun adult events in their calendar, and late night things to come out and see, like the laser light shows. I have grown to thoroughly appreciate science, and I know my fascination started here.",2013-08-23 20:13:15

I scheduled a girls night out with 12 ladies and have to say I didn't love it.  We love going to tapas style places so that we can all share and try a variety of things.  I'd say the ambiance is nice, the presentation was excellent, the food was okay, the staff was friendly and the drinks were good.  The layout seems more open than when it was Fly bar. But it was sad because I was wishing I was eating at Fly bar the whole time. There aren't very many vegetarian options.  They said they were working on it but I feel like this day and age it should not be an after thought.  It was raining so we didn't check out the rooftop area.  

For appetizers and entrees we got: the papas bravas, grande asparagus, tuna crudo, bacon wrapped dates, ensalada de casa and ensalada de remolacha asada, queso manchego, stuffed peppers, lamb & pork meatballs, gambas al ajillo, pescado de provision, pollo al pastor.  Nothing stood out as amazing to us. With that said we had a lot of vegetarians with us.  

For dessert we got: Torta de tres leches and the churros de la Abuela. The churros were pretty dry but the tres leches wasn't bad just more dense than I'm used to eating. 

We got a variety of cocktails and everyone was happy with their drink but one girl did have to send back her wine due to it being served in a dirty glass.

Came here for dinner on a Sat night. Didn't have reservations but there was room at the ""Chef's table,"" a bar in the back right by the open kitchen. That was actually pretty cool because we could watch the chefs prepare all the food and see all kinds of dishes going out.  It was also pretty quiet back there so we could talk. 

Most of the food was delicious and well executed. We tried about 75% of the menu. The standouts to me were the Korean Kim-chi tacos and the Dan Dan noodles. I also really liked the eggplant & tahini dish with pita. 

The Kim-chi tacos were my number one favorite, and I don't even like Kim-chi! The Kim-chi flavor was subtle and everything else about it was amazing--great flavors and texture, good crunch with the slaw. It was perfect. 

Dan Dan noodles were great too and not too spicy, with a nice hint of peanut flavor in the sauce without being overwhelming. Could have had more mushrooms though.

The cauliflower was also really great, with great flavor in the sauce.

The Peruvian fries are popular among Yelpers so we tried them and were seriously disappointed. They were just bland and nothing special. Totally forgettable dish. 

I loved the cocktails BUT they are expensive for the size. I would have been completely satisfied if they were either cheaper, or if at the same price then a bit larger--the cup seemed to be 50% ice for all of our cocktails. 

The service was prompt and attentive, but not that friendly. 

Also our waiter recommended a beer to us that we didn't end up liking at all (just a bitter Pilsner) and didn't even offer to bring us a different one. When he asked how we liked it and we told him we didn't love it, he just kind of shrugged and walked away, which was a bit weird. We ended up getting another cocktail instead. 

Overall I would come back, I know what my favorites were and what I wouldn't order this time around. 

I also love that it's the kind of vegetarian place that meat-eaters (like myself) can enjoy and don't feel like they're missing anything, because many of the dishes are that good!",2016-03-27 19:58:30

- Salads/veggies were fresh
- Attentive & friendly staff
- Enjoyable background music & atmosphere

- I would have loved to have a decent Arnold Palmer...
- Great place for a pescatarian or lenient vegetarian but not so much for a strict eater or vegan

And up until this review, we haven't had a bad meal yet but something was bound to go not as planned.
The music, atmosphere and architecture are on point, interesting and well done. I used the ladies' room and it was clean and well stocked. My husband used the men's room and said that there were no paper towels. Ok, that's strange because when we got there there were perhaps about 10-15 in the restaurant. Not that busy. Didn't anyone check the bathrooms before opening the doors?
We sat down to order. No bread or anything to nibble on while we wait. I only drank water, hubby ordered a vino verde by the glass which is on the menu. Vino verde is slightly green in color; it is served very cold and it is light and refreshing. They bought him a glass of Pinot Grigio; it was unmistakable. Not one for sending things back, he drank it anyway.
My husband ordered the pork chop, I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was in this great sauce but I couldn't eat it because there was no spoon on the table. We had to ask for it. Both dishes were very nicely prepared though. We shared a mixed green salad with a very light dressing, almost imperceptible, but still nice with pecans and manchego cheese. No salt and pepper at the table which means the chef is saying he thinks the food is perfectly seasoned & customers should  it mess with their food. Well, isn't that up to the customer to decide?! Don't pull that pretentious stuff. You are not in Paris or New York. There are a lot of great restaurants in this city that have earned a James Beard Award that put salt and pepper on the table! The restaurant describes itself as ""Mediterranean"". We asked for an expresÃ³ & were told they don't make expresÃ³. We asked for regular coffee & they said they ran out this morning. So between this morning and this evening (a whole 8-10 hours later) no one thought to go to the supermarket (or Walgreens) and buy some coffee? Who is running this place, the little rascals? Amateurs! Ok, moving on. We ordered a decaffeinated coffee with creme  brÃ»lÃ©e and an angel food cake with lemon curd & berries. The brÃ»lÃ©e was fine; nothing extraordinary, just fine. The angel food cake was a hockey puck; it was dense like a pound cake and tasteless . It was dry and tasted store-bought: they added some lemon curd (or lemon flavoring, not sure), berries and whipped cream. I could not finish it. All said and done the bill was about $100 plus 20% tip because servers work hard and I don't  believe in punishing them. Management/Owner, pay attention! If you want your neighborhood ""upscale restaurant"" to really stand out, pay attention to the little things. If you are not serving expresÃ³ don't say the restaurant is influenced by the Mediterranean. Those people drink expresÃ³ all day long. Take a visit and you will see. If you are going to charge these prices, ($30 for one pork chop, the meat was two fingers wide by 4 fingers long & as thick as an average thumb--odd shape, I know), make sure everything else is on point. And no regular coffee?! So much coffee comes into this port! Come on, you can do better. Hate to say it but they missed the mark.

The reason I'm mixed is because we paid $50 to reserve a bay, but when we got there it wasn't available. The staff was very nonchalant about it, and actually suggested it was our fault for paying the reservation two days in advance and not double checking again the day before. Our card was charged the $59 and they had all our info,  it they actually told us it was our fault for not double confirming. I pointed out that it is not typical to have to double confirm a reservation made-- especially if a $50 fee is attached to making that reservation. If they expect people to confirm the day before on top of that-- they should say so since it's not standard practice to ask customers to do so. They response was that they were ""much bigger than a restaurant"" so we should have called to make sure it was in order. That didn't make sense to any of us. 

 Until I started showing that I was upset with their response, they didn't even offer any kind of gesture of apology. Paying $50 to reserve a bay does not go toward the playing costs-- it simply guarantees you can immediately access a bay to play-- no waiting. So, to have paid $50 and not get the benefit the the bay actually being saved was annoying. 

The staff was a bit condescending about their response to the situation as well. The male manager stood uncomfortably close to me and said ""what can I do to make you happy"", but when I started to tell him I thought they should refund the reservation fee, he interrupted me and told me I was being rude. I wasn't cursing or yelling so I was pretty astounded that he would cut me off to say that after asking me a question. I turned away told him I was just answering his question and pointed out I wasn't yelling or cursing and that it seemed like he wasn't interested in my answer-- Then he apologized and let me finish. At that point- per my request, he agreed to put the money we paid for the reservation toward our game time charges. 

The female lead on the deck we were on kept coming by after we got started and saying things that were a bit pointed-- like ""Are you guys having fun now?"" ... like, emphasis on ""now?"".  :/

An odd thing to say when it was them that created a crappy start to the day. Yes, we were moving on and putting it behind us, but those comments felt like loaded digs instead of genuine check ups. 

Overall-- the act of actually playing was SO fun. I would love to do it again.  But the experience I had with the staff makes me hesitate. I filled out their customer service survey afterward and asked to be contacted by someone so that I could explain the score I gave, but no one contacted me. I'm torn between wanting to go try again and being wary of another situation coming up where I'd have to deal with condescension and rudeness. It was a bad look for them. 

It seemed cultural-- not situational because they were very comfortable being illogically rude when we had a very good reason to point out that they had charged us for a service they did not provide. â",2018-07-24 01:15:33

At first the service was good, the product is generally good; but this will be my last visit for quite a while. There are other places that make great boba drinks in Tucson.
Today I waited for the order of the person before me to be complete before I was even greeted. I thought that my order would be treated witht he same level of respect. No, as so often happens here, the  people walking in get their orders taken right away while you wait. Then they start to make their drinks at the same time as they make yours so you wait longer.
When I finally tired of hearing the extensive chit chat with the person who came in when he should have been making my drink. I mentioned that I was in a hurry and that I would like to have my drink.
Well here is the list of the reasons why my request was wrong:
1. I should have told them that I was in a hurry
2. ""We try to be nice to all of our customers"" They should have added except you.
3. There was no concern as to what my issues were and there was no consideration that perhaps I might have a valid point.
When I tried to make my points I was always drowned out by ""I'm sorry, but..."" And we all know that the ""but"" after the ""I'm sorry"" negates any apology; instead it is a justification for their actions. 

Additionally the boba was not fully hydrated today.

I can get a similar product that makes me just as happy a little ways away on Ina and there are two Vietnamese restaurants that make screaming good boba drinks.

Irma was my first Hurricane. I'm SO GLAD that she didn't cause the destruction I thought she was going to on my friends and family, but that's not to say she didn't suck! She totally sucked. She was a sucking c word from hell, and she took lives and power and she didn't even total my stupid car so I can get a new one. She did take our power for a couple of days. Anyways. Restaurants started opening and all I really wanted was a hot meal that wasn't Oreos and PB&J. I'm the worst at preparing and had to work all the way up till Irma day, so I was very poorly prepared. Lots of Oreos and PB&J's for us! 

The news said that LongHorn opened at 5 on their Facebook feed. Yay! We checked in at 4:50. The news was wrong. Heh. Fake news? That's right. We waited. We waited until 7:15. People were complaining. We waited. Finally our buzzer buzzed and we went in. Our poor server was so busy. She had some large tables that weren't friendly at all. Hello?! We just had a hurricane and your server is coming in to work to hustle her up some tips, so I suggest you people hush your mouths and give her your money and appreciation. 

We ordered prime rib, a kids cheeseburger, and I got the Parmesan crusted chicken. The salads and bread came out quickly. We got stuffed on said salad and bread, but that's why it's there I guess. 

The manager in duty apologized for the long wait. Apparently the to go orders were absolutely out of control and stalling progress. Also, they were out of baked potatoes. All of that is fine. It's all okay. Our food was delicious. Our server was fantastic. I even took the receipt so I could mention her by name, but of course I lost the receipt. 

My family is not going to remember ten years from now how much it sucked with three days worth of no power. We aren't going to remember how much the kids complained without their electronics, and I'll probably forget how bad my teenager smelled by day 3 of sponge baths in the sink, but we will remember the fact that LongHorn bounced back and opened the best they could, and that we got to have an incredible family dinner the day after our first hurricane, and we were served by a girl who's wings were on point!

The flavor of the wings are pretty good, but the way they come out always varies.

I ordered 12 a few days afterwards and they barely have a nice crunch to them. One of my favorites is habanero, which isn't THAT spicy or bad if you can handle hot cheetos/sriacha. 

I also used to love the criss cut fries but the last batch i ordered was way too crispy and was a salty gross mess. Waste of $4 & minus brownie points forsure.

I'll preface everything I am about to write by saying this...The intention of this review is to hopefully snag the attention of an owner or manager at Marcello's who can take some action and make some much needed changes, namely on organization and timeliness...despite the food was very good. 

The night started by us arriving 10 minutes before our party-of-two, 8:30 PM reservation, no one was was at the hostess counter, we waited at least 15 minutes until someone came back addressed us.  

After being seated, no bread, water, or drinks came until almost 20 minutes later...this is unacceptable, I'm sorry.  There's no excuse in the book - the restaurant was busy, but I've seen 150 times busier with less staff on the floor in many places.  And before I get someone commenting on this that ""I don't understand"" ""I've never worked in a restaurant before"" and whatever you wanna throw at me...Well, I also worked in hospitality for a long time, high-end restaurants too who would get PACKED on the weekend, and yes...there were nights when we were under-staffed, over-booked, and stressed beyond belief...but none of that matters, especially to your patrons.  Your patrons come in, looking to get service, not to get ignored...we only had one drink each (not by choice), waters were only filled up once, and it took us nearly 2 and half hours total of dining until we could leave.  
  
Our waiter that night at Marcello's (while extremely nice) was literally running all over the restaurant, it appeared he was working in three different sections, yet there seemed to plenty of wait-staff around doing nothing. Everything took forever to get, and when I say ""everything"" I mean our food... This is a direct result of poor management, or management who just doesn't care of enough about their employer or business.  Total shame too, because that personable waiter with the great attitude had absolutely ZERO guidance that night from anyone...Perhaps I'm wrong, maybe it was simply he, who was just that unorganized...but I am giving him the benefit of the doubt after reading a number of reviews on here that encompass the exact poor experience we had.

The only reason I gave Marcello's 2 stars was because the food was truly incredible, but that doesn't excuse the poor service....You're in the SERVICE INDUSTRY.... and with that said, we will honestly never go back to Marcello's, ever...And one more thing - unfortunately we did not get a chance to eat dessert, after it took almost 30 minutes for our waiter to bring over a dessert tray, yes, that's right...I said it took 30 minutes to see a dessert tray.  By that point, my girlfriend and I were there for nearly 2 and half hours, and it was time to go.  

Again, I hope this finds a manager or owner....you have really, really, great food....but your poor management and service is going to kill this place, I guarantee it.   The restaurant business isn't something you can halfheartedly go about running...you're either in it or you're not.  So figure it out. 


Best,

We ordered:
Oysters-YUM.  Extremely fresh, large, and perfectly reminiscent of the sea
Seafood gumbo-fairly tasty  
Shrimp Po-Boy with fries-very disappointing.  The fried shrimp itself was good with a crisp batter, but the flavorless, overly-chewy bread and mayo drenched lettuce that accompanied the shrimp did not make for a very good sandwich.  The fries tasted a bit stale as well.  

Our server was well intentioned, but had to be asked for everything.  
1) Can we have some utensils?
2) Can we have some napkins?
3) Can we have plates?

You would assume that we were at a dining establishment and actually eating that these questions would have been a given...

And if you've never been here, you can order deli sandwiches and things of that nature. I chose salad bar. Typically it goes well, but today was a button pusher.
It starts with the moment you order...i understand they are trying to provide service, but it's kinda pointless. You pay, the cashier hands you a yellow receipt that you then turn 180 degrees and hand it to a person that then hands you a tray with a bowl, butter knife, soup spoon and a fork - the fork is really the only utensil needed. Now I'm fully armed with flatware and when i was placing my order the cashier asked if i wanted a drink, i said water. In retrospect and being a fan of Idiocracy, im surprised i didn't hear ""ya mean like from the toilet?"" 
So im about to get my water and had to go back by the register because i wasnt given a cup. Nbd, just grab a cup - red acrylic, average vessel. As I'm dispensing ice into my cup the employee that handed me my tray, bowl, napkin and flatware leaves his order of duty to place hault to my action, takes my ice filled, acrylic cup and hands me a cardboard ""to go"" vessel. 
Whatever. 
I fill it with ice, water and on my way to the salad bar. 
I eat a lightly padded bowl of my select items and head back to the bar. As i approach the refrigerated unit in which they keep bowls, with my eyes steady on the flatware specialist in anticipation of his scrutinous intstruction. Only to be intercepted by yet another impressive employee. He asks what am i needing, i tell him another bowl. He reaches in the refrigerator and grabs a bowl. Turns back to me and asks if i paid full price. I explain ""i got the salad bar"". He then hands me the bowl but before letting go he notices this bowl is smaller than the common salad bowl. By now I'm somewhat frustrated with the level of difficulty this experience has achieved. Im staying cool. These are young people, we must help them grow. 
I say in a matching tone ""what's the difference?""
He subscribes to my logic and walks away.
It seems one individual that is on top of the game is the bus person. I got back to my table - everything is gone. The tray, bowl, flatware and yes, my cup. So now i get to go ask for another. The cashier, who has stayed on my good side apart from not giving me a cup at the start, hands me a completely different cup. It's smaller and clear plastic. I was hesitant to see if flatware fella was going to have issue but he stayed on task, doling out bowls and flatware to patrons. I finished my salad - which was good, and made for the door. 
Normally i dont complain, but this odd salad circus event was too daunting (as salads go anyway) to not have this story told. I'm not saying don't go or I won't be back. Not at all. 
Go. Enjoy. Maybe have fun with it, i most definitely wish i did and will know better in the future.",2016-10-20 19:18:16

It took them 2 months to get it back to me and then when I informed them it did not look good and I would rather exchange it for something of equal or more value, they refused and said that any resized jewelry is not returnable or exchangeable which is the most bull*** response I have ever heard. All they did was add links to the bracelet so why can't you just take it out??

Then I disputed with Visa about it and they were not providing proof of any wrong doing and just kept saying it was store policy without providing proof. Nowhere on the documents or receipts did they say that resizing jewelry was non refundable or exchangable.

But, today I had one of the most horrible service experiences of my life. When we arrived, we were asked ""dine in or take out?"" and when I said ""dine in"" we were told to pick any table that had menus on it. We did, and took the booth on the far left, just past a Christmas tree that was set up for the holidays. After we ordered our food and took off our masks, I noticed a heavy, artificial scent that was overpowering. I looked around for an air ""freshener"" of some kind but found nothing. I walked across to the other side of the room (where there were also booths with menus) and the smell was much less severe there. We moved our glasses of water over to the new booth and sat down. Our waitress came back and asked if there was something wrong with our first table. I explained that there was a strong smell, like maybe some sort of air freshener being dispensed that it was intolerable so we moved. She looked visibly annoyed and shot back snottily that they have no such air fresheners or anything there (although she never went over to the old table to see if she could smell it), and looked under our new table with obvious displeasure on her face. I asked, ""is it OK, that we moved?"" and she said, ""it's just that I just cleaned under there"" in a very annoyed sort of way.  I said, ""I'm sorry"" with sincerity. She said, ""it's OK"" in a way that made it obvious that it was NOT ok with her.  Then she walked away with me still asking (to her back), ""are you sure? Because it doesn't SEEM OK with you.""
The food was deposited with MAJOR attitude.  She then walked across to the table we had been sitting at previously and YELLED across the restaurant to another waitress, ""_____, can you please come clean table #xx? It needs to be cleaned again"" in a very put-out sort of way. Recognizing the problem here was that we had created one moment of ""extra"" work, I offered to solve the problem. ""I'll clean it, I don't mind. I just couldn't sit there anymore but I'm happy to clean it"" I said. Our waitress then went on to say that it was not just the old table that had to be cleaned, but that she had just swept under our new table and she only gets a certain amount of time allocated for that and now she would have to make time to do it again. I offered again, ""well, get me the broom and I'll clean it for you. You see, I don't mind doing a little bit of work, it's fine with me."" She stormed off, yelling about us to anyone in the kitchen who would listen, and I could hear her saying things like, ""I don't care, I'll take it off my...(something unintelligible)"".  Next, she stormed over to our table, slammed down two to-go containers, and said, ""your lunch is on me today. You don't have to worry about your bill"" and seemed to expect us to pack up our food on the spot and go. I said and did nothing and she stormed away.
We finished our lunch at the table, being entertained a little by the other young employees horsing around in the kitchen (someone giving piggy-back rides), packed our leftovers in the provided to-go containers, left a $20 bill on the table for what I calculated to be an $18.28 check and left. As we were walking out, someone shouted ""happy holidays!"" after us (in a way that might have been sarcastic), but I cannot be sure which of the young female voices it was.
We had decided to go to the Dairy Cottage today to celebrate my kid's acceptance at his dream college. When we were driving there, I told a story of how I remember going there when I was pregnant and Christmas shopping, 18 years ago probably to the day!

The best part of the meal, by far, was the dessert. We had the yin yang chocolate fondue, which was absolutely amazing! We both decided that, for the price, the best bet at The Melting Pot is dessert. If we drop $100+ on dinner, it will be at St. Elmo or the Oceanaire instead. 

When you get dinner at the Melting Pot, the meat is served raw and then you cook it at your table in the fondue pot. A  good concept, and the waiter will give you some guidelines for how long to cook each piece of meat and vegetable. However, after a few glasses of wine or cocktails, your sense of time is a bit off... or at least mine always is! Needless to say, we ended up overestimating and underestimating some of the cooking times. I don't know about you, but eating slightly raw pork is not my idea of a fun birthday dinner, much less the ""romantic"" experience that the Melting Pot is always made out to be. I think that the restaurant would be really wise to invest in some fancy stopwatches for each table, so that you won't lose track of time. 

We had the whole three course she-bang which included an appetizer cheese fondue, and yes, I am working backwards in this review. I absolutely LOVE almost every kind of cheese, but not Swiss. Perhaps I am strange. Almost all of their cheese fondues include some amount of Swiss cheese, which makes sense since fondues originated in Switzerland. I hoped I wouldn't taste the Swiss, but I did. Yuck! If you don't like Swiss, and think you won't notice the taste... think again. I am sure these fondues are delicious if you do enjoy the distinct flavor of Swiss cheese though. 

One final comment: this restaurant is usually rated one of the most romantic restaurants in Indy. I don't get it. It's nice and all, with cozy booths and candlelight, but my boyfriend and I didn't think there was anything all that special regarding the romance factor.",2008-10-29 01:17:26

I'm pretty furious as I only occasionally get pedicures or manicures, and have never had an issue!!

The salon came recommended to me from a friend who lives in Roxborough, who gets her nails done a lot, so it fooled her too! 
-For their pedicures, they put a plastic bag over the tub, I thought this was weird at the time. 
-They ""make your own box"" of equipment for you afterwards, there is no way they're not re-using that equipment on different people. 

They give their customers a drink at the beginning and they gave me a Korean face mask at the end, which I have since bought more of. But this salon is NOT CLEAN-DO NOT go here with so many CLEANER options in the area!

I'm sad to say that Viva has gone down a bit in my opinion. 

First of all, the Thursday salsa lesson went on a bit too long. 8pm until almost 10? Enough already -- just turn on the real music and let us dance!

Once the dance music started, things got a little better. There was a nice mix of men and women, although around 11pm, it got too crowded to move comfortably on the dance floor. 

But the biggest reason why I'm dropping this down to three stars is for the TERRIBLE bartenders. Both women were hands down, the RUDEST bartenders I've ever come across in my life. Just bitter, sour bitches. It was so bad that I only ordered one drink before I decided to close my tab and not deal with their nastiness anymore (and friends, I NEVER order just ONE drink).

Not a bad thing.  Then you try to speak with a hostess to get a table and EVENTUALLY they will acknowledge you but then on my first visit for Monday Night Football I was told that no tables were available.  Okay, that seemed a bit strange given that I saw at least 5-10 four tops that were completely open and only a couple people who appeared to be waiting for tables by the host station but instead we chose to sit at the bar, have a few drinks, and some appetizers.  Even at the bar service was fairly slow but they made an okay drink and finally the food came out after quite a long wait.  Cochon de Lait tacos were actually quite good - after adding salt.  The side dish of Mac & Cheese was also decent - after adding salt.

The space has huge ceilings and lots of wood and TV's as you would expect from an upscale sports bar, plus the outside courtyard including bar seats that are served through open windows is a pretty cool option.  There only appeared to be one large TV outside though so for watching games it's probably not ideal.  In terms of food it appears Manning's does a decent job for a sports bar other than the kitchen having an aversion to salt so only eat here if you're comfortable adding salt to bring out the flavor in whatever you order.

On my first vist Manning's was average or maybe a bit below - it's obviously got a ton of Harrah's money in it so I don't really call this a ""locally owned"" place despite Archie Manning's involvement.  I'd like to go with 2.5 stars (which Yelp reviews appear to have pegged perfectly) but will round down to 2 and I definitely prefer to spend my money at local places in the future.  However, with the lack of good sports bars in NOLA where you can get a seat and have decent food I may return to Manning's at some point.  I'd like to hope it will be better, but all around there is little indication that much improvement can be expected.",2012-11-13 20:04:59

Maybe it's because I don't really care much for noodles in soup. Maybe it's because my first experience with pho was a bad one (lettuce turning pink, ick!)

This time around, I was wiser and went with their vermicelli only option with pork. I ate that whole bowl having learned my lesson about ordering apps at southeast asian restaurants! As many are saying, their menu is very limited with maybe two appetizers, a rice bowl, and three pho options. But I think this works well in their favor-- they have just a few dishes that they want to perfect, and they certainly did that with my vermicelli bowl!

We said no and before we could blink the check was on the table. If you're in the mood for a speedy meal, I guess this is the spot!!

I thought the pizza was ok. Their bee sting zinged between sweet and spicy in a way that could have been tempered if they had cooked the serranos in the honey. But that's a personal preference.

We adopted a male Chihuahua from your location at Petsmart. I asked specifically about his health and was told he didn't have any health issues. I asked for all medical and shot records since the last time I adopted from the Humane Society I wasn't given a complete shot record or medical history. I was shocked to find out when I had to get all the information needed from our previous adoption that she had teeth pulled. I didn't know until almost 9 months after she was adopted. This is why I asked before adopting Finn. I'm told no problems. 
Finn starts sneezing Monday. Nose running and mucous. We take him to the Humane Society Clinic since I have a free visit within 2 weeks of adoption. I called first thing in the morning and they didn't return my call. I wasn't waiting around. We have other canine family members so we need to make sure Finn is ok. 
Not only were they completely unprofessional and rude, they made a ""mistake"" by putting Finn on the floor to be adopted. He has kennel cough and his meds started on the 12th. He needed to take the meds twice a day for 10 days!!  We adopted him on the 16th. Let's do the math!!
Then we were lied to and told they didn't start his meds and hand us a bottle of meds with a syringe. We get in the truck and the meds were open and the syringe was filthy with left over medicine residue!!
We have adopted so many dogs from this facility at their outrageous prices and given them forever homes and we are treated this way?? Not even an apology. We love Finn and he will be loved forever!!
Maybe the media should know about this so we don't have another ""oops"" situation!!",2014-03-19 21:27:37

First off, ticket prices are EXTREMELY cheap.  Sometimes a big name act will come through and tickets will be, at most, $50.  Markus Schulz is coming in for $20! and AC Slater was $10!  You can't beat this price.

I've been to pretty much every club from DC to New York, and I tell you what the BYOB experience is KILLER.  Waking up with a credit card damaged to the tune of $500 at Pacha in NYC is a thing of the past.  People complaining about having to pay $10 to drink their own beer blows my mind.  You can't get two beers in Philly for $10 after tax and tip! I hope this place never gets a real bar!

Getting inside is so simple.  If you're 21+ and brought beer, go to the 21+ entrance.  If you didn't bring beer, go to General Admission.  Not hard.

Once inside if you're 21+ you are lead privately to your table if you reserved one, or the bar if you didn't.  It's $2 to check a coat and $2 for a pitcher of mixers.  Insane deal! Show me another club you can drink Grey Goose and cranberry at all night for $12.

As for the crowd, oh well.  It's 17+ but some people are writing like it's this big deal.  I don't go to clubs and concerts and worry about the people around me.  I'm there for the DJ and the music and as long as someone isn't straight up grabbing me, I'm good!  It's nice to see kids have a place to go.  I wish this place existed when I was 17!

All in all, this place rules.  You can Facebook, Tweet and phone them at any hour and someone will answer your questions.  They are super nice, helpful and will do anything you ask.  It's also new, so give them a chance to get things figured out!  I'm sure in a year or two all the complains will be addressed, but for now I'm loving it and plan on coming back tons of times.",2013-02-22 23:15:29

Sazerac- strong just as expected
Ramos Gin Fizz- another egg white binge. I was expecting it to be a little sweeter but it was veryyy light
RIP Old Fashion- liked it much better than the Sazerac, a little twist from a traditional Old Fashion. Peach Tea infused and Peach preserves. Good!
The Garden District- Earl Gray Tea infused with mint- very very good and light! Love it!

I have always seen these buses rolling around downtown with a load of inebriated fools and wondered what the attraction was.  It wasn't until I started researching..... man these buses were cool!!  Initially I was most interested in the ice-themed  ""Cool Bus"" until our party steadily grew bigger and we upgraded to the ""Glow Bus"".  A bus with bright neon and black lights, full of all of the accoutrements one needs for a night of drinking and partying.  Suddenly, we were the drunken fools riding around downtown yelling ""PARTY BUS!""  Wait, what?

That's right!  This company knows how to help you get your Party on!  It was such a great time.  Forget that they have a disclaimer that they may not have all of the songs that you would want to hear....they have over 75,000!  And the DJ really knows how to keep your party going!  I cannot imagine what these drivers and DJs have seen while under their employment with FADDs... I do certainly know however that anyone from our party shouldn't be running for a political office anytime soon!

The bus itself was a great experience....well decorated, plenty of room to store personal items and it comes with coolers already stocked with ice.  A platform centers the bus for drink central (we had our wonderful friend and drink aficionado bar tend)  He was passing out those French 75s like they were bottles of water!   There was plenty of chairs to sit alongside the bus and the dance floor was adorned with two dance poles that shockingly enough probably have some stories to tell as well.

Booking the bus was super easy...the gal that helped arrange this was really friendly, professional and timely with getting back to me.  We initially booked the bus for 3 hours. When we were heading back to our drop off point, my super inebriated husband, who was having the time of his life dancing nearly naked with all of his guy friends around the stripper poles gave a shout out to the driver and DJ for an extra hour....they took the time to verify with ME that it was okay.  I thought that was super cool because that last hour isn't cheap...but It was so worth it!

Someone should just hand these people the keys to the city, or the keys to every restaurant in Tampa so they can go in and either (a) show every other restaurant what they are doing wrong or (b) shut every other place down so everyone has to come to Datz.  They would be doing the public a favor,  However, Datz, should you choose option (b), I expect to have a table on reserve so I don't constantly have to wait behind the entire city.

Since my first review in January of 2014, my girlfriend and I have been here on a few occasions.  We've been making our way through the brunch menu, and it's a bit silly that I am choosing to update my review now - after another dinner (first review was dinner, too) - instead of after brunch.  Would have made more sense to review a different menu.  But first, who the heck are you to tell me what I should and should not review.  Stop lecturing me and go to Datz.  Second, okay, good point.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the details of all of those brunches.  I can tell you I got the chicken and waffles benedict, the shorty benedict (short ribs), the eggs barbacoa, and the pastrami benedict.  I am pretty sure the lady and I also split the creme brulee french toast, but I might be imagining that or thinking of another restaurant.  If I am imagining that, then it looks like I'm going to Datz for brunch this weekend because I need me some creme brulee french toast.

Anyway, if I completed reviews for each of those, then every single one of those reviews would have been 4 or 5 stars, and mostly 5.  There may have been one or two instances where I liked an item less than another and would have gone to 4, but I would have taken those as just off days at Datz where every day is a 5 star day.

Okay, I just finished 3 freaking paragraphs and haven't gotten to this meal yet.  Impressive.  Moving on, for this meal, we started with the buffalo cauliflower.  I saw ""we,"" but I had one bite and that was it.  It's not that it was bad, it just wasn't for me.  An entire head of cauliflower baked, then lightly fried and tossed in buffalo sauce.  It would have been much better had it been chopped into bite size pieces, deep fried (preferably in bacon fat) and then tossed in buffalo sauce.

For my dinner, I got the hungryman 2.0.  The menu describes it as 2 southern fried pork chops, smothered in sausage gravy, house made bacon onion marmalade, and garlic mascarpone mashed potatoes  Oh my lord my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.  One small bit of false advertising - I wouldn't call it ""smothered.""  There was a small amount of sausage gravy, more than a drizzle, much less than smothered, and frankly, there could have been more.  The pork chops with the bacon onion marmalade were fantastic.  Mashed potatoes were awesome.  You just can't get food this good outside of fine dining restaurants.

Also got their Ebberson's Old Fashioned - Buffalo Trace bourbon, dolin rouge vermouth, cheery bitters. with cherries and candy bacon garnish. People, if you like bourbon (like me) but don't really like it straight, then this drink is one you must get.  Went perfectly with the meal.

Did I mention bacon onion marmalade on the food and candied bacon garnish in my drink?

I mentioned to my girlfriend during dinner that when I used to work in restaurants, there were always one or more regulars.  They didn't necessarily come in every day, but it was their Wednesday dinner, or their Sunday dinner place.  They would come every week, same day same meal, and I never understood that.  There have been restaurants I went to frequently, but never on a schedule.  Well, with Datz, I would be on a schedule.  Daily.  Every meal.  I might even repeat a meal or two every now and then.

Have I mentioned how much I like Datz?",2015-01-26 22:18:56

It's clear that Starr puts a lot of effort into the theme of his theme restaurants. This one is no different. Charming and comfortable, but without that TGI Fridays kit feel (although I do remember the old Ground Round silent movie kits... those were nice). Multiple floors and all those little rooms were a lot of fun and added to the experience that you're in an old English pub.

The cocktails were wonderful. Not watered down nor overly sweet. I had a couple, and the specifics aren't important (or remembered). A good cocktail is savored in the moment, not reminisced a week later. I get the sense that drinks are an important element in the Starr empire. If so, that's a really good thing. More, please.

The food: meh. Sure, it looked beautiful! Fish and chips on a cutting board... wow! Liver parfait shaped like a rugby ball (and almost as large), neat-o! But, alas, the food isn't amazing. It's good, though. Good enough to accompany the cocktails. Good enough to be in that space. And, good enough to visit again.

Will I tell friends who go to Philly that they JUST GOTTA stop by The Dandelion? No. But if they are looking for a good cocktail after work I'll add this to the list of options.",2011-09-23 02:37:42

It was OK, I've tasted better...maybe if they didn't drench it in bleu cheese dressing and used actual bleu cheese then maybe it would have been pretty tasty. I tried their 8oz steak last time and that was seasoned pretty good - I should have gotten that instead!

I'll start with the food because I know you hungry Yelpers want details on the grub. It's incredible! I've dined at many a restaurant and let me tell you no entree has ever tantalized my palate the way that every dish at Seagrass has. Their food provides a euphoric flavor explosion in your mouth. You'll experience new tastes that you've never had before and every morsel will have you wanting to lick your plate for more.

I've dined there several times since my initial visit two weeks ago and here are a few of my absolute favs: foie gras (done beautifully with smoked eel on top!), pork cheeks, pork belly, gigantic oyster shooter, beet salad, scallops and blood sausage, almond financier and profiteroles - oh, and don't let me forget the kalamata olive bread! 

For those of you who follow my reviews you know that I am a glutton for great service and Seagrass delivered exactly that! Really, it was exceptional service if I'm being completely honest. Our server, Rubin, was so warm, friendly and inviting. I felt like I was dining at a friend's home, not a restaurant. The staff at Seagrass have the wonderful capability of making you feel like you are a part of their family. Rubin was also incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. He provided such eloquent descriptions of each dish that I inquired about on the menu, that my boyfriend and I decided to take one of each and ended up having a nearly 7 course meal. It was fantastic!

Okay, so let's address the pocket book. I'm sure that many of you are concerned about your cash flow just as I am, but let me assure you that Seagrass will not break your bank. 

They offer fine dining quality food, service and atmosphere without the fine dining price. Tues - Thurs they offer a 3 course meal for only $35. Sundays are ""Laid Back Sundays"" come as you are, board shorts and all, and enjoy a 3 course meal for only $28. If you're an Axxess card holder you can buy one entree and get the 2nd entree free for dining before 7pm tues-friday through the month of June. Bottom line, Seagrass has something for even the most discretionary budgets. 

This is the type of restaurant that I will return to over and over again because they seem to operate with the customer in mind offering deals, seasonal menus of fresh organic fare, consistent, quality customer service and in a very warm atmosphere. 

If you haven't been here in a while, or were worried about a stuffy air because Seagrass is the Zagat rated #1 restaurant in Santa Barbara, you will be pleasantly surprised by how affordable and friendly this establishment is. They are under new ownership and from what I've experienced these new owners are taking this restaurant to even greater heights! A++",2011-06-22 17:35:25

We got in at the opening for lunch 11 :30. Order the calamari nero and pizza umbra. There is just one other table occupied at that time.
After a few minutes a waiter comes with our two plates in the hands and serves them to the other table!  We're quite surprised that the only other table in the place ordered the same (relatively unusual) items as we did.
After a few more minutes the lady at the other table calls the waitress (a tall blonde woman) and gives the pizza back. Obviously they served the plates to the wrong table.
Notwithstanding the waitress brings the pizza back to the kitchen, rearranges it and then puts the pizza back in front of the pizza oven. We're in full view of the oven and watch carefully to see if another pizza is being prepared. Not so : nothing goes back in the oven.
After a few minutes we call the waitress and ask her what's going on with our pizza. ""Oh ! Huh ?"" she says pretending not to understand what we're talking about. We then let her know, in no uncertain terms,  that we've watched her shenanigans and that we neither expect nor  appreciate being served food which had been on someone other's plate for minutes. Her, disingenuous answer, was ""Oh ! No ! It's the wrong pizza"". Not enjoying being taken for two idiots we tell her that we would like to talk to the management she says :""oh! No!"" and goes away to put in an order for a new pizza.

First and foremost: DO NOT ORDER ANY PASTA DISH WITH CHICKEN unless it is a chicken breast, otherwise you will be getting flavorless cubed chicken. I ordered the Cavatelli Alla Siciliana with no mushrooms. The pasta was good and the sauce was decent, but it didn't taste fresh. Maybe it was full of oil or butter or something, but it didn't have that fresh taste. Again, the main problem was the chicken, which was cubed and flavorless. It had grill marks on the cubes, and, again, I was told it comes frozen or was frozen, but I would venture to say that those grill marks are on there already from the bag. It looked exactly like the cheap chicken cubes you would get at the grocery store that have no flavor and feel rubbery. Kind of like DOG FOOD, or something you would end up feeding your dog.

As one review said, it was kind of unkempt in there. The service was adequate and our waitress did ask the kitchen how the chicken comes and is prepared. I would not recommend this establishment, based on the food I had and the food the company I was with had. I spoke with a friend of mine who had also gone and tried the pizza, and he was not impressed. OH, and yes, the SALAD was basically provel cheese with iceberg lettuce added for whiteness, maybe?

Asian people raised in areas with an abundance of more ""authentic"" Vietnamese restaurants argue that NC is a very average/poor Pho spot while others claim for it to be the best in the greater SB area. The bottom line is, in comparison to the Pho restaurants in San Jose, SF, or anywhere else with a decent Vietnamese population, Noodle City is probably average.. Nothing special or extraordinary. 

However, for what it is- a reasonably priced family-run Vietnamese owned restaurant in Goleta, it's magnificent. I don't care if people cry and wine about how much better the Vietnamese food is in San Jose. In the SB area, a good and cheap Asian place is one in a million. I've tried the Pho, Bun, and Broken Rice plates here, and it is honestly the best Asian food in SB in my opinion. When I need that fix of Asian food after being stuck with the wonderfully diverse selection of food in IV (A burrito, sandwich, or burger??), Noodle City does the job more than adequately. Maybe not the BEST, but I think their food is pretty damn good. Recommend to anybody.

I was staying with a group (we had a group block) for a friend's 40th.  The online portal wouldn't allow me to book a room for less than a four night stay and the telephone operators couldn't offer me the group rate either.  I had to call the group sales person four (4) times to get the rate.  Why four times? She doesn't return calls (I tried over a week and did not call her multiple times over the course of a day).  I had to get someone else in the department to handle it.  Several days after I was booked, the person I had been calling finally called and told me I had the wrong rate (at least she got me a cheaper rate).

The top of my comforter had some sort of faded red stain on it (hurricane/fruit punch spill).  It was obvious and should have resulted in the comforter getting tossed.  I expect more when I'm not staying at a Days Inn.  I didn't complain because I had already unpacked and it was a relatively minor issue that I probably would have overlooked if not for what happened.

2nd night there, I left my hotel room around 6 PM to find a room service tray with empty food sitting in the hall.  That tray was still there at 2 AM and 8 AM.  That's right, 14 hours later.  So for those of you that think I'm being petty - hold on to your seats because the incompetence train is rolling into town.  

As I am packing up the morning after night 2, I find my toiletry bag had been moved to behind the towels underneath the vanity.  Why in the world would  someone do that?  Then to top it off, my ziplock bag for my toiletries was  gone.  It was inside my toiletry bag.  I assume that it fell out when housekeeping moved my bag and she decided to throw it out.  Strike 1 (but still minor and I probably would have commented to the registration on check out).

Then I cannot locate my Downy wrinkle spray.  Small bottle, goes in the ziplock bag works wonders taking out wrinkles.  I scoured my room for this spray bottle but couldn't find it.  Strike 2

Now, I am packing my gear and clothes and can't find my heart rate strap that pairs to my Garmin devices.  I had left it draped over my chair on top of my workout clothes so that it could dry.  I literally checked ever part of the room for it.  Couldn't find it anywhere.  However, I did find one of my iPad chargers and apple pencil thrown that I left on my dresser placed into a drawer of one of the nightstands (as you might surmise I didn't put them in there, nor did I put the local magazines that were on my dresser in their either). Neither my iPad nor my two sets of expensive headphones were touched.  Big strike 3

I called for a manager, security came instead.  They were polite, took copious notes, and downloaded the entry logs from the door.

I take what's left of my stuff & leave it in the host's suite (stepping over the room service tray to get there).  I proceed to check out - about 45 minutes after the security guards leave.

At this point I had not been given a summary of charges.  I tell the registration desk host that I wish to speak with the front end manager and I wanted to check-out.   She asked for my room number and said you have charges at (lists 5-7 places int he hotel) and asks is that ok?  I said I need to see the charges but where is the manager.  She said that she didn't hear me ask for the manager and then the other person said that she hadn't either.  I suggested next time they don't use their phones when talking to customers.  She said that the manager will bring a copy of the bill.

A few minutes later the manager, Randy, comes over but without a copy of the bill.  I explained the situation - he asked me how much the heart rate monitor cost and deducted that amount, and only that amount, from the bill.  Not exactly a great move towards satisfying a clearly annoyed customer.

Then I get handed the actual bill.  There are 4 charges on there totaling a little shy of $100 that are for two restaurants, a bar, and a coffee shop that I hadn't been too.  In fact two of the charges were when I was with the party in the suite and a third was when I was half way across town.  I told them that I had to leave for a tour, circled the four questionable charges, and asked them to look into them while I'm gone and refused to check out.  When I returned around 1:30, randy was working the front desk.  He produced two of the receipts - lo & behold - someone was using my name and room.  The signature wasn't close.   Randy immediately removed the charges.  Again, no accommodation was offered.

It's a nice looking hotel, maybe three to four stars but I would never stay here again and caution anyone that does to refuse housekeeping and closely monitor their room charges.

I don't eat out much, as I am a chef and I'm usually extremely disappointed with restaurant food in Santa Barbara. This is a new place (open 2 months) and so I thought they must be eager to make a name for themselves. The waiter bragged about the menu and so did the host and owner. I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Burger because the prior review caught my attention. I was very specific about he color of my meat: medium/medium rare, which is slightly more towards medium. Instead of fries I got ceasar salad. I paid $21.00 for a burger so I thought ""This'll be grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!"" I brought the bag home, opened the container and started-in on the salad. In a word, soggy... dripping in ceaser dressing. Amateurish. Next, the $18.00 burger. One bite and... ewwww... red as though it were barely cooked!!! I brought the whole thing back and got my money back. They apologized, etc but man, if the ""chef"" can't get an $18.00 burger right, can you trust anything? Highly unrecommended. All-male servers too. It's like a sport's club playing hippy music on a tranister radio sound system serving child-made food.

I always assumed that the McDonald's empire had some sort of review process or QC department to keep their restaurants running efficiently and effectively.  This has been our local McD's for about 4 years but we've learned to drive 3 miles out of our way for our Big Mac cravings.  Unless I was alone getting just a single burger, I avoided this place.  The ability to correctly fulfill and order for 2 adults and 2 children completely eludes this establishment.  My wife and I were trying to remember a time when we went here and they got everything right, we couldn't think of any, seriously.  
Last time I was there (about a month ago) I ordered $6 worth of food and they asked me to pull up because they had a problem with they're fryers and it would be a couple of minutes on the fries. No problem.  I turned the game on and waited... 25 min.  I know I should have went in after just 10 min, but I'm a pretty patient person and they started bringing food out to all of the other cars that were waiting (about 7 of them) so I figured it wouldn't be too much longer.  When I finally started to get out of the car the empty handed manager was knocking on my window.  He explained that they lost my order and needed it again.
I'll refrain from detailing my ""conversation"" with this man, but suffice to say it was my last visit until I see ""New Management"" on their reader board.
Reviewing a fast food joint always seemed silly to me, low priced food = low wages = lack of interest in getting your order right.  It's a risk we all take every time we buy food from the front seat of our cars.  I just wish someone would have warned me how consistently bad this place was.  Screaming kids in a long drive-thru is bad enough, but seeing their disappointment when their nuggets aren't in the bag time and time again is too much.  Lesson learned, albeit a little late.

The McD's at Elm and 370 is much faster and the one on 5th street seems OK but it's kind of a pain to get in and out of.",2010-12-29 18:58:33

After parking in the free lot near the Piazza, we saw Darling's and thought we would blow through--quite literally, as ""blustery"" would be an understatement for the tornadic conditions last night. 

We sat at the bar to get a drink, and it turns out that one of the owners was tending bar. He asked us if it was our first time there; we said it was. Upon hearing that we were first-timers, he went into the back and called the other owner to come out and meet us. They both introduced themselves, asked where we were from, and were exceptionally welcoming. 

While we didn't plan to eat anything, as we had reservations coming up, they talked us into a couple of small plate appetizers that were freaking delicious. The pierogies were just insane. They came out in a kind of alfredo cream sauce, and were amazing. We also had the potato pancakes, which come with some high-quality apple sauce and sour cream. They also recommended the cheesecake (it had won an award), but we decided not to spoil dinner--next time, for sure though,

The beer selection is also very good here. They have some good local brews on tap (Kenzinger, etc.) and a good bottle selection--everything ranging from Rogue Dead Guy through Colt 45!

When I called initially I kept getting bounced around from one department to another until An employee named Sue Ellen that worked at Island Grille (I hope that's her name because that's what I heard on the phone but could be mistaken-but I do know she's fairly new and recently moved from Arizona). Sue Ellen was determined to help me and went above and beyond to get my information, understood my situation and had so much compassion and determination to help me get these poor guys some beer in their rooms before they arrived. She took my information and the next person I had contact from was an exceptional employee by the name of Bre Mayumi. Ms. Mayumi went ABOVE and BEYOND to help me out. She gave me options, was extremely patient and made sure everything was taken care of! She put together a variety of beers to be delivered to their hotel rooms and even asked if I would like her to write a hand written note to leave them. I let her know what I wanted the note to say and she left them the sweetest card (it was a bachelor party so of course it had to be a little funny as well). All of the guys were EXTREMELY grateful for the beer selection Ms. Maysumi picked out and the grooms favorite part was the card she wrote!!! Ms. Mayumi is the definition of EXCELLENT customer service. She did not have to offer to write a note and she was so patient and sweet throughout the ENTIRE process.

Once our favorite spot for Italian in Nashville, sadly we are not sure whether we will return.

We started with caprese salad, which had very bitter basil which we had to discard, which left tomatoes, mozzarella and balsamic, all of which was very average.  .  Next, my wife had her favorite mussels, which were cooked with an herb that was too strong for delicate fish and they were overcooked.  I had spaghetti with ragu sauce and meatballs.  The spaghetti was much under cooked, about 5 minutes short of ""al dente"".   

Service was good, but the regular servers we had seen for years are all gone.  While convenient to the downtown activities, the quality here has disappeared.",2015-04-13 15:54:07

I lost nearly 70 lbs. two years ago and didn't do anything active to do that.  I have since maintained but recently, a very good friend challenged me to a 40 days of fitness for Lent.  I would not normally do this, but I resolved I would try new things this year and health is always on my ""to do"" list.  In the last two weeks, I have tried pilates, hip hop, Zumba, working out at the Y, going for a jog on the treadmill, biking and nothing is ""sticking"". I'm staying with it b/c I am dedicated to my friend but thinking .....the countdown is on until I am not going to work out again for another year.  I tried, right?

Well -- that is just -- silly.  And a thing of the past.  Due to horrible weather this past Sunday, my Florida trip was canceled and I was invited to hot yoga by another great friend. I rolled my eyes but agreed to join her b/c she promised brunch after would be ""earned"".  I love brunch.  

And now, I love hot yoga.  Ohhhh how much do I love thee?  Well, I signed up for 2 weeks of unlimited classes and in the last four days, I've gone to 5 classes and constantly looking for a time to squeeze in a class.  Somehow I went from not having time to working out to spending 1 hour and 15 minutes a day at the hot yoga studio at the City Center and hoping to try the Broadripple location soon.

Why do I love it?  I don't know.  I am not intimidated for one thing. I have taken 4 different teachers' classes at 4 different times and enjoyed all of them for different reasons.  They challenge without pressuring you to get into a pose.  Anytime I need to, I go to child or downward dog and the flow of the classes is really great.  They move you through poses in a way that truly makes sense for me and my body and allow me to breathe through and go at my own pace.  Each of their styles are VERY different.  I really enjoy Audrey's low voice and kind hearted encouragement while really pushing you to get into the pose.  Shannon's music kind of rocked my socks and I felt invigorated to return that SAME night to Jez's class (her last sadly) where she helps stretch you out at the end. Today I experienced Suzanne who got me into about 6 new poses I had not tried.  She really challenged me and it was by far the most sweating I had done!  

Ultimately, I am not a ""yogi"" by any means especially prior to this (does 5 random classes count over the years?) but I never feel silly or pressured to do something I cannot do. I do not feel judged or hopeless. I feel totally the opposite. I feel challenged, enlightened, weightless sometimes and like I'm RIGHT where I'm supposed to be.  I think they might pump some yoga crack in there!  It's cool -- I'm all in.

I plan to do the 30 days challenge after my 2 week unlimited classes end just for fun and b/c it's a great affordable option running through the end of April. I highly recommend giving it a try (and using my name if you feel compelled -- message me for my last name).

I have not in any way been paid to write this review. I truly do not usually LOVE classes or want to return to anything, but the calmness and disconnectedness I feel from the fast pace of my every day life is truly gone inside this studio. 

I love that it is always so warm and cozy, there are NO mirrors anywhere in the room (or bathroom for that matter) AND it's dark in the hot room.  Yes, dark.  I love this aspect.  It feels like you are almost entirely alone even when the room is full.

Tips:
-- come 15 minutes early so you can acclimate to the hot room.  It is warm and at least 90 degrees so it's good to get in there and lay allowing your lungs to get used to it.
-- leave your valuables locked out of sight in your car. The one thing I don't love is that there is no where to lock up your items.  There are shelves and hangers but there is no security in place for your items. 
-- First class includes a complimentary mat/towel and it's $5 to rent theirs after. 
-- Do the unlimited classes for 2 weeks.  Try out lots of classes and teachers.  You will find something you like.
-- Don't give up after your first class.  If you are in the room and breathing (as Shannon said), you are doing yoga.  
-- Easy parking at the top of City Center behind Divvy.

I also LOOOOOVE that this location is in my ""zip code"".  It is less than 10 minutes from my house so convenience is KEY!  There is a spinning studio in the same space.  They also have a challenge going on.

Decent, not great though. Nothing felt fresh and there weren't any distinct Asian flavors.

Side note: I don't know if it was OrderUp's problem or Bento, but the delivery experience wasn't the best. Maybe the guy was new? I had ordered to have something to be delivered to work, because I couldn't get away for a break and it took over an hour (which I was willing to brush aside).

Let's just get a few facts out of the way here  Cal Neva Casino has both midget wrestling and karaoke. There is nothing like playing blackjack while someone warbles out Sweet Caroline and everyone at the table screams ""bah bah bah!"" It's enough to drive you out the door through the small walkway and into the other side of the casino.

Cal Neva also has $3 blackjack tables. If you go to these tables very late at night the other gamblers are as entertaining as the wrestlers and singers on the other side. Sir Nicholas and I played for about an hour with a guy who was smashed and had some real gems for quotes throughout the night like the following:

(To the waitress) ""Hey! Bring me two shots of jager and a relationship.""
(Later to the waitress) ""Can I get your address?"" (Nick and I weren't sure about the thought behind this one - why not start with a phone number, man?)
(After being admonished by the pit boss for being to loud and kind of under his breath.) ""I really gotta learn how to wrestle."" (Because the night always ends well when you wrestle a pit boss.)

He also insisted that Nick and I were in a band - Nick played a guitar and I was the singer. He went so far as to tell us he had brought his guitar and was going to his room to get it because he demanded Nick and I play him one of our songs. He then said that we probably lived in the city (true), drove a Prius (not true), only watched Indie movies (definitely not true as I enjoy Lifetime originals on Sunday afternoons just as much as the next girl), and listened only to Indie bands no one has heard of. He followed this up by yelling, ""Don't judge me!"" at us. It may sound obnoxious, but to Nick and I it was highly hilarious and entertaining.

The service was terrible.  But they must have undergone a management change since then, because we've had several excellent experiences with them over the last few months, so I thought I'd post about it.

First, the drive-thru service, which used to be awful, has improved tremendously.  The last 4-5 times we've gone through it, it's been relatively fast, our order was filled properly, and we were given more than enough extras and sauces and so on.  The drive thru was actually a pleasant experience, which is 180 degrees from a year ago when they couldn't fill an order right to save their lives and we actually complained to their corporate people.

We've also dined in within the last few weeks, and the service inside was excellent as well.  We were actually greeted at the door by a hostess that had a menu and kid's menu in hand, meaning they saw us coming and prepped before we even got in the door.  Our waitress was attentive during the meal, the food came out in a timely fashion, and the manager even stopped by to make sure everything was alright.

I love the food at Steak 'n Shake, and typically get a double burger, fries and chili.  Love the chili.  Usually get a diet Coke or Coke Zero, with cherry syrup added.  On rare occasions a strawberry shake.

If you had a bad experience with this particular Steak 'n Shake in the past, give them another chance.",2010-03-25 17:17:58

I'm giving this two stars because, out of the five in our party, two got a decent meal, and the soup was okay. So I'm being generous. 

Service started off bland and remained bland as if she really didn't want to be there. Not my problem. It also took a while and was slow throughout. 

Drink orders came. Bread was ok. Half a container of butter with each basket of bread. Fine. Soups came out. They were fine. 

Meals finally came out from a person whom appeared to be the manager. The three kids meals were fine, however, one had carrots with ranch as a side. How hard is it to get this wrong? Easy apparently. The carrots looks like they had been placed under a food dehydrator. 

I ordered the crab cake with sirloin. That plate came out maybe warm. The steak was cold to the touch on the sides, like it had been in the refrigerator from being cooked earlier, then gently reheated. Not to mention it looked like a piece of leather. The garnish was wilted. The hush puppies were uncooked in the middle. The crab cake was good enough to proceed with. I mentioned that the steak was cold, she apologized like it wasn't the first time, took the plate back, brought it back out. Same plate of food, just slightly reheated. The hush puppies were now slightly burnt. And the steak now not the med well as we had asked for. My wife asked for steak sauce. That took 5 minutes.

I walked into the store and started to look at things.  A staffer looked directly at me and said nothing, making it seem she was either too good or I was unimportant.  It was likely apparent that I was unfamiliar with the store, but it didn't seem to matter.

Like all Big Lots, they have some good products, and they specialise in bringing international food items, and they should be commended for that.

Unfortunately, they have to care to win the crowds.

For anyone confused, this is nothing like a farmers market. There are a few meat places and an occasional veggie stand but it's mostly a bunch of tourist traps. 

Most of the restaurants are sub-par and have a large markup because tourists flock here. That doesn't go to say there aren't a few great eats here. I would definitely recommend Sang-Kee, DiNiCs and Pearls. You can't really go wrong with anything on those menus.

A big plus to the market is the Amish side toward Arch Street. Bailer's Doughnuts will put you into a sugary food coma and the wait at the Dutch Eating Place is well worth the wait (Don't miss out on the apple dumplings). 

Just a note. If you are new to the city and are looking to save a little cash while eating fresh produce, go to Iovines. This is still a family run business, the produce is usually great quality and the prices are great. Usually lower than big grocery stores. You can regularly find berries for $.99 a container on special in the front.

There are definitely some great spots at the terminal but overall it's for tourists and the shops are generally more expensive than the equivalents anywhere else.",2015-06-22 15:52:02

It has taken our child and family a long time to process and recover from the experiences there. We wanted to write an honest but not overly raw review to help prospective patients and families understand what they might experience. My husband and I read all the reviews we could find before placing our child there. There were no glowing reviews and we tried to take the negative ones with a grain of salt. We needed a residential treatment center within driving distance that was covered by insurance and able to help our child with serious mental health needs. The main goal was to get stabilization from medication, something we had not been able to do with outpatient or acute inpatient treatment. After a little more than 4 weeks, our child was worse off in terms of stability and we made the decision to remove him from Willow Springs.

Aside from one wonderful therapist named Heather, friendly cafeteria staff, and a few compassionate techs on the boys' hall, the staff was awful. Our concerns began with the admissions woman who over exaggerated the programs and lied when assuring us a few minor concerns with our child's physical health would be addressed. The nursing staff got his medication wrong multiple times and failed to administer antibiotics after a physician prescribed them. I had to call multiple times to get things on track. The psychiatrist called him the wrong first name the entire stay and did not listen to our concerns regarding medication. We did not get his medication stabilized until we brought him home, weaned him off the medications prescribed at Willow Springs, and worked with an outpatient doctor. During a family visit, a nurse interrupted to address a behavior concern between our child and another patient. It set our child into a rage, demonstrating the nurse's lack of professionalism and ruining the few hours we had with our child for the week. When typical therapy was not working, Heather asked for help from her supervisor. This woman told us she did not believe in the existence of the DSM outlined and mulitple doctor agreed upon diagnosis for our son. She wanted his therapist to try some occupational therapist style exercises that were not applicable to his needs. Her comments about his diagnosis not being a real thing and her lack of strategies to help our child were the final determinant in our decision to remove him from the facility.

Our child was the youngest in the boys' hall and a very unfortunate result of being around older, tougher boys was a lot of taunting, stress, fighting, and exposure to yet more negative behaviors. The anxiety and fear created in the boys' hall is detrimental to patients and staff. The nearly brand new shoes he wore to the facility were ""lost"" during his stay and we were not reimbursed as promised. Most of the mail we sent to him was never received by him and we are still receiving some returned mail 7 months after his stay.

It is awful to need a level of help for your child that you cannot access easily, affordably, and with confidence. My heart goes out to families struggling with mental illness.",2019-03-30 22:18:22

We were greeted immediately when we walked into the establishment. There were so many options to order from. I asked for assistance in choosing my order.

I looked around behind the workers to see if they were in the process of cooking more fresh and new meat. Unfortunately they were not. My lunch time is limited to a time constraint. So I just ordered the chicken ranch BLT quesadilla. The flavors from the ranch dressing enhanced and covered up my dried out chicken.

This place delivers a delicious sampling of island food to the hardy denizens of Tucson. I ordered the chicken katsu with curry because it reminds me of my childhood days (yes, I grew up on Spam musubi) and although the wait was a bit long (lunch hour), the staff, owner were very nice and circulated around, checking on everyone and chatting. I was not disappointed--the chicken katsu was tender and fresh with panko crumbs. I normally don't like macaroni salad but their salad was so good. Two baseball sized scoops of sticky white rice. My grandma would've been pleased to see all this food. And oh, the portions...You had best come hungry!!

Before going there, I had seen other reviews on Yelp that mentioned mediocre service, but I figured it wouldn't be bad for a short happy hour. However, I was wrong. Our waitress only visited us once or twice and she got our orders wrong and was rude when we asked if it could be corrected.

Hell, the whole city could use more restaurants like this.  The atmosphere is modern and tasteful, dark, cool, and pleasant, though the design seems to be trying a little too hard for cool.  That's not really a bad thing; it's endearing rather than offensive (If it matters, they seem to have gotten the music thing under control.  Again, it's more funny than off-putting).

If you can't be bothered to read the whole review, I'll give you the takeaway message right now: order a big Sapporo draft (or Kirin Ichiban if that's your thing) and a couple or three of the small plates.  You will enjoy it.  Bring friends so you can trade bits of the appetizers.  If you're still hungry, order some of the killer noodles.  Maybe the sushi's good, maybe it isn't.  I haven't bothered to find out because the rest of it is great.

Detail-wise: the gyoza are rich, redolent little pockets of juicy flavor that come with a great citrus sauce for dipping.  It's not the overpowering raw soy flavor most places give you.  The takoyaki are intriguing, with an internal texture that's somewhere between a pancake and a set custard, spiked with bits of meaty, chewy octopus and topped with the deep ocean funk of katsuoboshi.  The seaweed salad is redolent of sesame oil and has a satisfying crunch.  Also, try some of the fried skewers.  I got the pork, which was crunchy on the outside and came with tonkatsu sauce, which is sort of what you'd get if barbecue sauce and ketchup gave birth to a talented and delicious child.  I can't imagine that they're any less talented at skewering and frying (or grilling) other things.

And if you're still hungry, there are noodles in abundance, and good noodles.  The ramen, if you're used to packets, will be revelatory (though it's not the best I've ever had, I eat it happily).  It's rich and filling, coming in head-sized bowls.  Even better is the yakisoba, a hot fried noodle dish that came out steaming and savory, with the meaty, slightly charred flavor that would, in Chinese cuisine, be called wok hee.  It's like what you wish lo mein could be.

The food's great, the beer is cold and appropriate to the food.  There are even karaoke rooms you can rent.  What's not to like?",2010-07-08 01:25:39

Since diet Coke and Prosecco can keep nearly indefinitely, this is a sign of management failure (people or process, and since I haven't experienced this in Collegeville, it would seem to be people).",2018-11-12 06:28:51

We chose him because we liked his professionalism, energy, and attention to detail. They priced it right so it moved fast. At the time, we longed for a larger condo in the same area. Daniel signed us up to get emails whenever anything came up in that defined area, and finally one place caught our eye.  As it was a desirable area, Daniel suggested we move fast, so we all did. His team was absolutely fantastic in meeting with us to consider improvements to the new place, quickly securing financing, etc. Our offer was accepted.  But after some soul-searching, we realized it was impractical for us to buy there at that time, so we backed out of the deal (at no loss for us whatsoever, but much time and spent by the Zia Group) and instead bought in Scottsdale to be near family. Scottsdale has its merits, certainly, but hope springs eternal that we can have it all -- the beach air and desert life!

My friend bought me a Smart Circle card that gave me 5 treatments for a total of $50 plus tips (there's a mandatory minimum 20% gratuity with each treatment).  I was very satisfied with every one of them.

Massage - Upgraded my 30 min massage to a full 50 minutes, and I'm glad I did.  Ike was my therapist.  I have some serious trapezius muscle spasm, and he's the only massage therapist that's ever been able to work it out completely.  Big thumbs up here.  Also, he used a great massage cream that didn't leave me feeling greasy and dying for a shower as soon as I got out, like most other massage places I've been to.

Facial - 30 minute ""Get Up and Glow"" facial with Stacy.  She was really pleasant to talk to and tailored the facial to meet my skin's specific needs.  I looked and felt radiant when I got out.  She also suggested specific treatments to help with hyperpigmentation and dryness.

Nails - just your basic filing, cuticle treatment, and polish with Winnie, who was also great to talk with.  Manicure lasted a lot longer than they usually do on me (I'm active and work with my hands a lot).

Waxing - also with Winnie.  Eyebrows, lips, and chin were included, but since I don't have any chin hairs, we just did the first 2.  I've only had my eyebrows done twice before, but she gave me a really nice arch that was better than I've seen with prior eyebrow waxes, and didn't rip my skin off.  I guess that's really all you can say about a wax.

Hair - cut and styled by Nicole.  She gave me a great cut that works well with my hair texture and oiliness.  She used a great volumizing shampoo and mousse.

The place has a great relaxing atmosphere, especially given its busy Center City location.  Their receptionist, Mark, was very nice every time as well.

I can only compare this to one other spa in town, Rescue Rittenhouse.  The Phoenix was WAY better for me.  Better massage, and the facial didn't make me break out like the one at Rescue did.  Would be happy to go back once a month or more if it weren't for the cost.  Sadly, their regular prices are way beyond my reach, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5 from me.

They made a two-hour sales pitch, measured windows and gave three prices:  a retail price, a discounted price because of a current promotion, and a price if I ordered windows right then. The ""now"" price (the lowest of the three) was approximately 36% less than retail price. I asked for a written proposal.  All I got was a brief email with the retail price.  I asked to see the individual cost of each window, and I was allowed to look at salesman's iPad and briefly scroll through list of windows. 

The Andersen window product seemed to be a well-designed one--if you can afford to pay more than the cost of your entire first home just for windows. I did not like the high pressure sales approach, though, and the fact that there was no explanation about how the final cost was derived made it seem like ""magic"" math was taking place. These sales people seemed to be trying to trick a gullible buyer into a deal without providing information and a contract that would be required by consumer protection agencies for such a large purchase.

The nook-and-cranny locals' places like this always have more character, besides.

Thanks to Groupon and another site, I was alerted to this restaurant, found very enlightening reviews on Yelp and dined there on September 1.  Long week, long travel day, compounded by miserable rain, and a quick tasty meal  was in order. 

My server, Jaz, was very friendly and patient with me (so much good stuff on the menu, and I was starving and couldnt decide).  The greeter and other staff were equally inviting and friendly, in person that day and also for my take-out order another day.

I ended up with a side salad (gigantic) and a fried oyster poboy (gigantic and delicious -- impossible to get good fried oysters anywhere but Nola and I dont like them raw).  A perfect comfort meal that hit the spot and I certainly was back on my weekend trip.  My lunch on September 5 made this 5 stars, hands-down.  

For a bite on-the-go, I thought I'd grab a shrimp po-boy and soem of the famous (per the menu) hand-cut wings.  I was absolutely overwhelmed -- the bag felt like someone had mistakenly put someone else's larger order in it.  

The po-boy was gigantic -- the the point that I decided to enjoy each large shrimp (you're talking 26-30-count or larger) individually -- yummy by the way with light and perfectly seasoned batter -- and make an impromtu salad of the lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles.  The wings were equally spectacular -- very large and meaty and the barbeque sauce/seasoning was out of this world (like what you'd expect in a BBQ specialty restaurant).  

Trust me, the folks near me on my flight were wondering where did you get ""that?""   I certaily wonder why folks can't make the 2-block trek from Bourbon St for this great comfort food -- vs. straggle into a fastfood joint with nasty, cold burgers (just because it's on Bourbon) for a combo price that is the same as a po-boy or wings etc.

We ordered lobster bisque, a dozen oysters on the half shell, charbroiled oysters, cioppino, seafood skewer, and brussel sprouts. I think the highlight of my dinner were the oysters for me. They were very fresh and meaty and had a very good flavor of the sea. Even though they were $1.50 happy hour oysters, they were very nice quality! The charbroiled oysters on the other hand were just ok. The cheese on it was too salty and did not melt into the oyster and did not have much flavor other than the saltiness. I've had a lot better elsewhere. They were pretty fresh though. 
The cioppino was also very good. Flavor was nice and was a hearty portion with a good variety of seafood. Would highly recommend. 
The lobster bisque also had a nice flavor. One tip i recommend you to do is remove the puff pastry and put it on the side rather than into the soup because it can get soggy and gross after a while. 
Im not going to talk about the brussel sprouts since I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts at all.
The seafood skewer I had was alright, nothing too special about this dish, but I've never had swordfish, so that was the appeal and it's not bad. Would not really recommend this dish, it wasn't special, you get 1 skewer, 2 sides and it's $19.
Also, the complimentary bread and butter before the meal was excellent and worth the mention. The bread was super crispy on the outside and warm and super soft on the inside. Was so tempted to fill up on it.
Overall the food from favorite to least favorite of the night goes like this: oysters on half shell, cioppino, lobster bisque, seafood skewer, and charbroiled oysters. 
Service on the other hand was not bad, our server was Angela and she was friendly. 
I can't wait to come back and try their lobster specials on mondays and Tuesdays. When I asked how much they were today, was told $60 for lobster. And the lobster special is less than $40! 
Also, I recommend getting their Groupon to save on your meal! I saved $30 tonight on my meal and my Groupon was $18 (save $12).",2019-02-24 05:41:05

I said what are you doing what is this  his stupid response it's a drop shadow (I GUESS)..you guess... I said I wanted a ALLL red tattoo he had nothing to say then said he'd try to fix it and added pink and some other colors I did not ask for... then proceeded to tell me I was done and this is what I asked for... with my tattoo ALL outside of my outline just SLOPPY then wanted me to pay 150 NOT FOR THIS.I waited over 4 hours patiently for this tattoo because it's really what I wanted.

then they  tried to say I waited so long so I could get a free tattoo like who dose that when 75% of my body is covered in tattoos ...So now after the shit show was done I tried to explain my self to the beetle juice looking MF in the front and all they were doing was talking over me and telling me this is what I wanted told me to leave and slammed the door in my face.

A group of eight of us came here and we all ordered different things.  I had the special rotini pasta with a poached egg and (allegedly) shaved truffle.  I detected one or two truffles, and they weren't real strong.  The broth was too watery, so that when I opened the egg, the yolk was absorbed and kind of melted away.  The rotini were not home made, but ok.  My main course was the lamb sliders (yeah, an appetizer, but I had eaten another meal 2 hours before).  Ground lamb, a bit of sauce, and not bad.

I tasted two other dishes, one fish which was boring and lacking in flavor, accompanied by zucchini if I remember correctly, but I don't, which means it wasn't memorable, but not bad either.  The other dish was a pasta bolognese dish.  Very tasty, and spicy too.

Two wines, a white and a red.  Both overly sweet not real expensive American wines.  Boring.

It's a bit pricier than our usual dinner places, but for special occasions or the one-off dinner, it's great.

The atmosphere is trendy, modern and classy.  The staff is friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  While the menu is somewhat limited, it is all of very high quality and the flavor is almost always spot on.  One dinner item that stands out is always the scallops.  Scallops can be all over the board and theirs are always cooked perfectly.

As I mentioned earlier, almost all our trips in there are for drinks and dessert.  Their cheese plate is kind of a build your own arrangement and I've yet to be let down.  We always have the bread pudding when we come in.  It's like those homemade desserts your grandma used to make.  Perfect texture, flavor and size.

Pair it with a glass of their delicious port wine and you'll feel like you've gone to heaven.  

Speaking of wine, their wine list is extensive and covers just about every wine palate and comes from a wide variety of wine regions.  They also offer a selection of specialty cocktails and martinis as well as a full bar.

Yelpers - this place just went from a one to a three and a half stars!

We went back. Yes. I'm a yelper that gives second chances. That and I now live in SB so desperate times call for desperate measures. OR that's what happens when one is desperate for a simple cheap trim. We did a drive by to see if that same woman (read original post below) was working on a Saturday afternoon. No sight of her so we went in and I'm happy to report that my hubby got a great looking haircut. YES! Worth much more than the $19 fee. The place was actually buzzing with activity (a sure sign of a turnaround). The three gals working there were all sweet (and all Latina... coincidence? I think not:).
______________________________________________

I thought this place was ""Great Clips"" so I sent my in-need-of-just-a-trim husband to this place.  He marched back and told me it was a Fantastic Sams. But then I saw his hair. 

Oh. My. 

His head looked like a mushroom cap - long in the top and short and uneven in the back.  He was pretty upset. We had been robbed. Time to yelp it out and warn the good folks in SB.

Just to be fair about all the F-Sams out there, we stopped by a Fantastic Sams the very next day (Burbank, on Pass Avenue) to get the mushroom cap off.  The gal there did a great job and made comments like: who cut your hair? was she young? were you her first haircut?

Unfortunately, this place will most likely not last long. It's sad that a place with such great potential doesn't understand it's demographic.
1. This is a brewpub situated directly in the middle of a family oriented neighborhood. It does not have booster seats or high chairs, yet has a kids menu. 
2. The only outdoor seating that is shaded, does not allow kids because of some imaginary line they drew inside the building that sits ""behind the bar"". The seating is completely separate from the inside and on the exterior of the building, so that excuse made no sense. We actually had an employee tell us we weren't allowed to sit there. But you can bring your dogs out there, just not your toddler. 
3. The food is catered from Patrick's kitchen, which is a delightful restaurant and Patrick is an amazing chef (and a great guy in general). However, the price you have to pay for this is outrageous for what you get. 
4. They cater more to dogs and they do tiny humans. While we were sitting in the restaurant trying to hold onto our almost 2-year-old, there were several dogs on the patio that had water and doggy dishes brought to them. 
How is it possible that you think about providing water bowls for dogs but not high chairs for kids?

If you want a neighborhood restaurant and brewpub to succeed, you might want to think about the people that actually live within a mile of your establishment. Most of these people have kids and they are looking for a place they can bring the whole family and have a nice relaxing afternoon. My wife and I will not be back until we have heard that these issues are fixed. I hope this place doesn't fall under because they have decent beer and it's in a convenient location.",2017-07-09 20:31:44

The technician was at my house less than 2 hours later to quickly diagnose the problem and explain what needed to be done to fix the issue. The price he gave me was fair, and I didn't feel at all like I was being taken advantage of. I fully anticipate calling this company should I need any assistance in the future.",2017-06-09 13:22:11

I got the vegetarian combination. I could not get over how good it was. Had a hot cup of the Yirgacheffe with it. Not the best Yirgacheffe I've ever had, but it was a nice compliment to the meal. (I think my standards for coffee are higher than my standards for food. This food was way above standard. The coffee could use some room for improvement.)

Friendliest service one could ever hope for. So kind and courteous.

The only thing more I could ask for would be to have Mulatu providing the soundtrack to my next meal here. After factoring in the cost of flying him and his band in from Ethiopia, that might make for an expensive meal. I think it'd be worth it.

I've been eating Indian for 20+ years all over the US and was vegetarian for 6 years so feel like I have a good understanding of what the typical US Indian restaurants serve. 

The buffet has a great selection - typically 5-6 vegetarian options, 3-4 meat options, several sauces (ginger, raita, plum, etc.), jasmine rice, salad, rice pudding, and naan brought to your table. I've been 6 times and each time they have several regular dishes (dahl, some sort of pakora, etc.) and other new dishes. The food is seasoned well and not overly spicy. Love the dahl and chicken makhani! The only dish I keep hoping will be on the buffet is palak paneer (hint, hint...).

The staff is friendly and efficient. My only complaint is that it's usually quite warm in the restaurant, but it doesn't stop me from driving 20 minutes to go there every other month!",2010-09-29 19:26:22

I love the grocery store overall, but the last time I was there, I decided to purchase two of  their ready-made salads, not from the deli, but prepackaged by the store. I bought a chicken one, and a shrimp and crap one. They were $6.25 apiece. They were larger than most of the other kind I would buy from other stores. I was however, very disappointed when I opened them and found a small amount of crab and shrimp, and the same with the chicken and cheese in the other. The container had mostly iceberg lettuce, about 90%. The price was way too high for that amount of lettuce. I would say, they made a huge profit off those salads. If you want to charge that price, then atleast add more ingredients than just the lettuce. I go to Sprouts mainly for their bread and the meat department. They have an excellent variety meat, which I like. This is the only product I have bought there so far, that has disappointed me.",2021-03-07 21:03:34
